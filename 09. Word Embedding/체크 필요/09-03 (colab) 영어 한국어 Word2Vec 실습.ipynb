I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world. I was in India this past year, and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world. There's nothing that makes you feel more -- the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that -- than to know that something that horrible no longer exists. So I'm going to tell you -- (Applause) so I'm going to show you some dirty pictures. They are difficult to watch, but you should look at them with optimism, because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist.\n","But first, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey. My background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect. When I was an intern in San Francisco, I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island, and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island, and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth. I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks. She gave birth; I caught the baby; I got off the island; I landed in San Francisco; and all the press wanted to talk to me, because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs. (Laughter)\n","I wound up on every television show. Someone saw me on television; they called me up; and they asked me if I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from San Francisco to England. And I said, yes, I would do that, so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called \"Medicine Ball Caravan.\" (Laughter) Now, you know from the '60s, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus; I was on the bus. My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus. Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London, then we switched buses at the big pond. We then got on two more buses and we drove through Turkey and Iran, Afghanistan, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, like every other young doctor. This is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus. We had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass. But we wound up in India. And then, like everyone else in our generation, we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.\n","(Laughter)\n","This is just like a residency program, for those of you that are in medical school. (Laughter) And we studied with a wise man, a guru named Karoli Baba, who then told me to get rid of the dress, put on a three-piece suit, go join the United Nations as a diplomat and work for the World Health Organization. And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated, and that this was God's gift to humanity, because of the hard work of dedicated scientists. And that prediction came true. This little girl is Rahima Banu, and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world. And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed, certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.\n","The key to eradicating smallpox was early detection, early response. I'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response. Can you say that?\n","Audience: Early detection, early response.\n","Larry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history. It killed more people than all the wars in history. In the last century, it killed 500 million people. You're reading about Larry Page already. Somebody reads very fast. (Laughter) In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin -- with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation -- in the year in which they were born, two million people died of smallpox. We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980. This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health, [Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest, and to be kings and queens of the world, did not protect you from dying of smallpox. Never can you doubt that we are all in this together.\n","But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective. You should see it from the perspective of a mother, watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly. Day one, day two, day three, day four, day five, day six. You're a mother and you're watching your child, and on day six, you see pustules that become hard. Day seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication. Day eight.\n","And Al Gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world, the most printed image in the world, was that of the Earth. But this was in 1974, and as of that moment, this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed, because we printed two billion copies of this photograph, and we took them hand to hand, door to door, to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house, because that was our surveillance system. We didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers, we didn't have computers.\n","By day nine -- you look at this picture and you're horrified; I look at this picture and I say, \"Thank God,\" because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox, and I know this child will live. And by day 13, the lesions are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen, but you know this child has no other secondary infection. And by day 20, while he will be scarred for life, he will live.\n","There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that. This is confluent smallpox, in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered by lesions. Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent of people who got it. And hemorrhagic smallpox, the most cruel of all, which had a predilection for pregnant women. I've probably had 50 women die. They all had hemorrhagic smallpox. I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.\n","In 1967, the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease. In that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox. By 1970, we were down to 18 countries. 1974, we were down to five countries. But in that year, smallpox exploded throughout India. And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand. In 1974, India had a population of 600 million. There are 21 linguistic states in India, which is like saying 21 different countries. There are 20 million people on the road at any time, in buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households, and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house, because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity, Shitala Mata, the cooling mother, and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the house. No incentive to report smallpox.\n","It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities; smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world. So, how we eradicated smallpox was -- max vaccination wouldn't work. You could vaccinate everybody in India, but one year later there'd be 21 million new babies, which was then the population of Canada. It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone. You had to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time, and draw a circle of immunity around it. And that's what we did. In India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door, with that same picture, to every single house in India. We made over one billion house calls.\n","And in the process, I learned something very important. Every time we did a house-to-house search, we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox. When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease. When we did search, we had the illusion that there was more disease. A surveillance system was necessary, because what we needed was early detection, early response. So we searched and we searched, and we found every case of smallpox in India. We had a reward. We raised the reward. We continued to increase the reward. We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house. And as we did that, the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero. And in 1980, we declared the globe free of smallpox.\n","It was the largest campaign in United Nations history, until the Iraq war. 150,000 people from all over the world -- doctors of every race, religion, culture and nation, who fought side by side, brothers and sisters, with each other, not against each other, in a common cause to make the world better. But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication. We failed three other times. We failed against malaria, yellow fever and yaws. But soon we may see polio eradicated. But the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response. This may be the year we eradicate polio. That will make it the second disease in history. And David Heymann, who's watching this on the webcast -- David, keep on going. We're close! We're down to four countries.\n","(Applause)\n","I feel like Hank Aaron. Barry Bonds can replace me any time.\n","Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about. I was just in India working on the polio program. The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door. That is the surveillance system. But we need to have early detection, early response. Blindness, the same thing. The key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys and finding out the causes of blindness, so you can mount the correct response.\n","The Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme, who, having climbed the highest mountain, tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease, wanted to do it again. And over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people. Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.\n","In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me that computer, which is Apple number 12, and it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working, and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva. And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health, and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done, and we had astonishing results. Instead of finding out what we thought was the case -- that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma -- we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract. You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there.\n","In your TED packages there's a DVD, \"Infinite Vision,\" about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital. I hope that you will take a look at it. Aravind, which started as a Seva project, is now the world's largest and best eye hospital. This year, that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India. (Applause) Bird flu. I stand here as a representative of all terrible things -- this might be the worst. The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response. We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years. WHO stages the progress of a pandemic. We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage, with just a little bit of human-to-human transmission, but no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission.\n","The moment WHO says we've moved to category four -- this will not be like Katrina. The world as we know it will stop. There'll be no airplanes flying. Would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know, coughing and sneezing, when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you, for which you had no antivirals or vaccine? I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October. I asked them -- these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza -- and I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them: What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic? If it happens, how bad do you think it will be?\n","Fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years. But much worse than that, 90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime. And they thought that if there was a pandemic, a billion people would get sick. As many as 165 million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression as our just-in-time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke, and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying, because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits, that the consequences are almost unthinkable. And it's getting worse, because travel is getting so much better.\n","Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like. So we know what we're talking about. Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia. It initially goes quite slowly. You get two or three discrete locations. Then there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you. Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world. Now, if we had an \"undo\" button, and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started -- if we could find it early, and we had early detection and early response, and we could put each one of those viruses in jail -- that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic. And let me show you why that is.\n","We have a joke. This is an epidemic curve, and everyone in medicine, I think, ultimately gets to know what it is. But the joke is, an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve. (Laughter) But you don't get to do that usually. You usually arrive right about here. What we really want is to arrive right here, so we can stop the epidemic. But you can't always do that. But there's an organization that has been able to find a way to learn when the first cases occur, and that is called GPHIN; it's the Global Public Health Information Network. And that simulation that I showed you that you thought was bird flu -- that was SARS. And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur. And it didn't occur because GPHIN found the pandemic-to-be of SARS three months before WHO actually announced it, and because of that, we were able to stop the SARS pandemic. And I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to GPHIN and to Ron St. John, who I hope is in the audience some place -- over there -- who's the founder of GPHIN.\n","(Applause)\n","Hello, Ron!\n","(Applause)\n","And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located, because not only did GPHIN find SARS early, but you may have seen last week that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran, but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 -- but last September. We need an early-warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare. And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences. Smallpox -- early detection, early response. Blindness, polio -- early detection, early response. Pandemic bird flu -- early detection, early response. It is a litany. It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread.\n","So, my TED wish is for you to help build a global system -- an early-warning system -- to protect us against humanity's worst nightmares. And what I thought I would call it is \"Early Detection,\" But it should really be called ... \"Total Early Detection.\" [TED]\n","(Laughter) What?\n","(Applause) What? (Applause)\n","But in all seriousness, because this idea is birthed in TED, I would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it the \"International System for Total Early Disease Detection.\" [INSTEDD] And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra. So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu, we find it and immediately contain it. Instead of a novel virus caused by bio-terror or bio-error, or shift or drift, we find it and we contain it. Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in Bhopal, we find them, and we respond to them. Instead of famine, hidden until it is too late, we detect it, and we respond. And instead of a system which is owned by a government, and hidden in the bowels of government, let's build an early detection system that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language.\n","Let's make it transparent, non-governmental, not owned by any single country or company, housed in a neutral country, with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent. And let's build it on GPHIN. Let's start with GPHIN. Let's increase the websites that they crawl from 20,000 to 20 million. Let's increase the languages they crawl from seven to 70, or more. Let's build in outbound confirmation messages, using text messages or SMS or instant messaging to find out from people who are within 100 meters of the rumor that you hear, if it is, in fact, valid. And let's add satellite confirmation. And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end.\n","And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world, finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them, and sending our response to them, so that next year, instead of us meeting here, lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world, we will have pulled together, used the unique skills and the magic of this community, and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics, other catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now.\n","(Applause)\n","Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation. First of all, just so everyone understands: you're saying that by creating web crawlers, looking on the Internet for patterns, they can detect something suspicious before WHO, before anyone else can see it? Give an example of how that could possibly be true.\n","Larry Brilliant: You're not mad about the copyright violation?\n","CA: No. I love it.\n","(Laughter)\n","LB: Well, as Ron St. John -- I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him. When he started GPHIN -- In 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu -- H5N1. It was in Hong Kong. And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately, by slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and birds, and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks. Immediate detection, immediate response. Then a number of years went by, and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu. Ron and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web -- only crawling 20,000 different websites, mostly periodicals -- and they read about and heard about a concern, of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu.\n","They reported this to WHO.\n","WHO took a little while taking action, because WHO will only receive a report from a government, because it's the United Nations. But they were able to point to WHO and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like bird flu. That turned out to be SARS. That's how the world found out about SARS. And because of that, we were able to stop SARS. Now, what's really important is that, before there was GPHIN, 100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things -- whether you're talking about famine or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola -- 100 percent of all those reports came from nations.\n","The moment these guys in Ottawa -- on a budget of 800,000 dollars a year -- got cracking, 75 percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN, 25 percent of all the reports in the world came from all the other 180 nations. Now, here's what's really interesting: after they'd been working for a couple years, what do you think happened to those nations? They felt pretty stupid. So they started sending in their reports early. And now, their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent, because other nations have started to report. So, can you find diseases early by crawling the web? Of course you can. Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now? Of course you can. You saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler. Well, they're only crawling in seven languages. These bad viruses really don't have any intention of showing up first in English or Spanish or French.\n","(Laughter)\n","So yes, I want to take GPHIN, I want to build on it. I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can. I want to make this open to everybody, so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar will have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC. And I want to make it part of our culture that there is a community of people who are watching out for the worst nightmares of humanity, and that it's accessible to everyone.</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2076\">\n","  <head>\n","    <url>http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_s_response_to_rick_warren</url>\n","    <pagesize>81930</pagesize>\n","    <dtime>Thu Jan 28 17:36:39 CET 2016</dtime>\n","    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>\n","    <content-type>text/html; charset=utf-8</content-type>\n","    <keywords>talks, God, TED Brain Trust, TED Conference, atheism, brain, cognitive science, consciousness, evolution, philosophy, religion</keywords>\n","    <speaker>Dan Dennett</speaker>\n","    <talkid>94</talkid>\n","    <videourl>http://download.ted.com/talks/DanDennett_2006.mp4</videourl>\n","    <videopath>talks/DanDennett_2006.mp4</videopath>\n","    <date>2006/02/02</date>\n","    <title>Dan Dennett: Let's teach religion -- all religion -- in schools</title>\n","    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Philosopher Dan Dennett calls for religion -- all religion -- to be taught in schools, so we can understand its nature as a natural phenomenon.

back.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"4666\">I love this wonderful gathering.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"7392\">And you must be wondering, \"What on earth?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"9613\">Have they put up the wrong slide?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"11289\">No, no.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"13426\">Look at this magnificent beast,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"17662\">and ask the question: Who designed it?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"23152\">This is TED; this is Technology, Entertainment, Design,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"27086\">and there's a dairy cow.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"28849\">It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"33104\">And I was thinking, how do I introduce this?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"35326\">And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"40000\">you know: \"Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"45004\">And you might say, \"Well, God designed the cow.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"47692\">But, of course, God got a lot of help.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"51525\">This is the ancestor of cattle.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"53858\">This is the aurochs.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"56739\">And it was designed by natural selection,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"58784\">the process of natural selection, over many millions of years.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"62719\">And then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"67274\">And human beings became its stewards,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"71947\">and, without even knowing what they were doing,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"74201\">they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"78521\">And then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"84783\">and figure out just what the parts were, how they worked</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"87578\">and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"92220\">Now, why am I talking about cows?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"96181\">Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"101489\">Religions are natural phenomena -- they're just as natural as cows.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"106862\">They have evolved over millennia.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"111438\">They have a biological base, just like the aurochs.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"115798\">They have become domesticated,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"117890\">and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"124138\">This is TED, and I want to talk about design.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"128000\">Because what I've been doing for the last four years --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"130937\">really since the first time you saw me --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"132981\">some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"136008\">and in the last four years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"137525\">I've been working just about non-stop on this topic.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"140961\">And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"146590\">Now that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"152177\">or anger, or anxiety of one sort or another.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"157743\">And that is the spell that I want to break.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"160194\">I want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"163933\">We should study them with the same intensity</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"167205\">that we study all the other important natural phenomena,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"170396\">like global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"175128\">Today's religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"179620\">They are immensely powerful social institutions</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"183977\">and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"189281\">that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"194333\">And, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"199729\">designed by natural selection itself --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"201722\">and intelligent design --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"204853\">more or less intelligent design --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"206691\">and redesigned by human beings</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"208413\">who are trying to redesign their religions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"212564\">You don't do book talks at TED,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"216168\">but I'm going to have just one slide about my book,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"220316\">because there is one message in it</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"223013\">which I think this group really needs to hear.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"225201\">And I would be very interested to get your responses to this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"230050\">It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"234719\">at this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"238106\">to know what other policy proposals to make.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"240749\">And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"245321\">Here's my proposal,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"246504\">I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"249458\">Education on world religions for all of our children --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"255026\">in primary school, in high school,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"257193\">in public schools, in private schools and in home schooling.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"261521\">So what I'm proposing is,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"263203\">just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"269087\">so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"276111\">about their history, about their creeds, about their texts,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"281000\">their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"286994\">And this should be presented factually, straightforwardly,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"291837\">with no particular spin, to all of the children in the country.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"298507\">And as long as you teach them that,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"301824\">you can teach them anything else you like.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"304713\">That, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"309363\">As long as you inform your children about other religions,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"314000\">then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"317170\">teach them whatever creed you want them to learn.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"320956\">But also let them know about other religions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"323616\">Now, why do I say that?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"327365\">Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"334250\">Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"341930\">Misinformed consent is not worth it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"345000\">It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"348247\">Democracy depends on informed consent.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"351000\">This is the way we treat people as responsible adults.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"356812\">Now, children below the age of consent are a special case.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"365608\">Parents -- I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"371223\">parents are stewards of their children.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"374159\">They don't own them.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"376286\">You can't own your children.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"378212\">You have a responsibility to the world,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"381919\">to the state, to them, to take care of them right.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"387843\">You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"393914\">but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"398764\">about all the other creeds in the world, too.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"402000\">The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"406492\">some of the reactions to this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"409663\">One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it \"totalitarian.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"416849\">It strikes me as practically libertarian.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"421071\">Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"424118\">I don't think so.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"425301\">All I'm saying is --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"427304\">and facts, facts only; no values, just facts --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"433252\">about all the world's religions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"436683\">Another reviewer called it \"hilarious.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"439900\">Well, I'm really bothered by the fact</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"443581\">that anybody would think that was hilarious.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"446224\">It seems to me to be such a plausible,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"450229\">natural extension of the democratic principles we already have</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"454649\">that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"460002\">I know many religions</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"463543\">are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"470204\">that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"477145\">I don't think that's defensible.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"480184\">But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"482842\">any reactions to that -- later.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"484393\">But now I'm going to move on.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"486540\">Back to the cow.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"488000\">This picture, which I pulled off the web --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"491388\">the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"494717\">That's the steward.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"496305\">Cows couldn't live without human stewards -- they're domesticated.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"501838\">They're a sort of ectosymbiont.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"505132\">They depend on us for their survival.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"510380\">And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"513747\">I'm going to talk about sheep, too.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"515470\">There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"519007\">How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"522940\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"525297\">Think of what this got them.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"527438\">They could outsource all their problems:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"530000\">protection from predators, food-finding ...</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"532635\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"533666\">... health maintenance.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"535025\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"537712\">The only cost in most flocks -- not even this -- a loss of free mating.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"544665\">What a deal!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"546673\">\"How clever of sheep!\" you might say.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"548573\">Except, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"551098\">We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they're not very smart.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"556427\">It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"558574\">They were clueless.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"561201\">But it was a very clever move.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"563159\">Whose clever move was it?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"564506\">It was the clever move of natural selection itself.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"568818\">Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"574625\">with Jim Watson,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"576412\">once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"579578\">Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"584853\">and Orgel's Second Rule is:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"586247\">Evolution is cleverer than you are.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"589960\">Now, that is not Intelligent Design -- not from Francis Crick.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"596479\">Evolution is cleverer than you are.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"598194\">If you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"601352\">why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"608216\">The designs discovered by the process of natural selection</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"612654\">are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"615058\">Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"620283\">But the process itself is without purpose,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"623472\">without foresight, without design.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"626358\">When I was here four years ago,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"627913\">I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"630858\">And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"634748\">with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"639944\">in order to reproduce.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"642342\">So it was sort of a spooky story.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"644000\">And I think some people may have misunderstood.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"646770\">Lancet flukes aren't smart.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"648874\">I submit that

<seekvideo id=\"1033202\">And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1037346\">I wish he could do this with a revision,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1041133\">a Mark 2 version of his book.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1045600\">\"The truth will set you free.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1047536\">That's what it says in the Bible,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1049467\">and it's something that I want to live by, too.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1052418\">My problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1057748\">Now some of this is a difference of opinion.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1062173\">And that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1065062\">Here's a passage -- it's very much what he said, anyway:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1068275\">\"If there was no God we would all be accidents,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1070798\">the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1073933\">You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1077335\">or meaning or significance.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1078843\">There would be no right or wrong</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1080449\">and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1082619\">Now, I just do not believe that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1084552\">By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1090756\">to that very claim.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1092861\">Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1096290\">We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1102548\">But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1106833\">That's not what I'm really worried about.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1109650\">How about this: \"God designed this planet's environment</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1112603\">just so we could live in it.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1115213\">I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1119679\">that we don't have to do the sorts of things</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1122323\">that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1124735\">I am not happy with that sentiment at all.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1127000\">And then I find this: \"All the evidence available in the biological sciences</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1131596\">supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1135304\">with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1138607\">a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1141315\">and explanation in this central fact.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1143356\">Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1146833\">And here, I think, \"Wait a minute.\" I read this again.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1150000\">I read it three or four times and I think,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1152063\">\"Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1154631\">Is he endorsing creationism here?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1156642\">And you can't tell.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1157901\">So I'm sort of thinking, \"Well, I don't know,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1160030\">I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1162451\">But then I read on, and I read this: \"First, Noah had never seen rain,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1166559\">because prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1171614\">I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1176537\">And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1179728\">after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1183475\">over millions of years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1186631\">discourages people from scientific understanding.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1189842\">Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1196411\">and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1200541\">Here's one: \"God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1203929\">in a way that makes your ministry unique.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1205998\">He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1212808\">I think that's false.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1215000\">Now, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1218618\">Here's another one: \"For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1222221\">Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1225964\">Well, it would be interesting to find the interpretation</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1228662\">where I would accept that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1230067\">There might be some way of treating that as true.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1233511\">\"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1236843\">hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1239522\">an inbuilt need to connect with God.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1243392\">Well, the sense of which I agree with him,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1245584\">except I think it has an evolutionary explanation.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1247988\">And what I find deeply troubling in this book</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1251833\">is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1255610\">if you want to have meaning in your life,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1257803\">you have to be an Intelligent Designer,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1260294\">you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1263839\">And I think, on the contrary,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1265342\">that it is very important to solving the world's problems</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1268307\">that we take evolutionary biology seriously.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1272427\">Whose truth are we going to listen to?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1275649\">Well, this is from \"The Purpose Driven Life\":</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1278225\">\"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1281542\">the compass I rely on for direction,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1283305\">the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1286146\">and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1289458\">Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1293869\">And here's one that does concern me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1297463\">Remember I quoted him before with this line:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1299840\">\"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1305335\">And that's a problem.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1309843\">(Sighs)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1310867\">\"Don't ever argue with the Devil.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1312535\">He's better at arguing than you are,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1314290\">having had thousands of years to practice.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1316700\">Now, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1320951\">It's an old move.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1322649\">It's a very clever adaptation of religions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1325224\">It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1330546\">\"You don't like my interpretation?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1332292\">You've got a reasonable objection to it?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1334268\">Don't listen, don't listen!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1336321\">That's the Devil speaking.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1339185\">This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1344810\">it seems to me that we want to have.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1347668\">I've got one more problem, then I'm through.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1350298\">And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1355593\">\"In the Great Commission, Jesus said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1357396\">'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1360282\">Baptize them in the name of the

I love this wonderful gathering. And you must be wondering, \"What on earth? Have they put up the wrong slide?\" No, no. Look at this magnificent beast, and ask the question: Who designed it?\n","This is TED; this is Technology, Entertainment, Design, and there's a dairy cow. It's a quite wonderfully designed animal. And I was thinking, how do I introduce this? And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer, you know: \"Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree.\" And you might say, \"Well, God designed the cow.\"\n","But, of course, God got a lot of help. This is the ancestor of cattle. This is the aurochs. And it was designed by natural selection, the process of natural selection, over many millions of years. And then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago. And human beings became its stewards, and, without even knowing what they were doing, they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it. And then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were, how they worked and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better.\n","Now, why am I talking about cows? Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions. Religions are natural phenomena -- they're just as natural as cows. They have evolved over millennia. They have a biological base, just like the aurochs. They have become domesticated, and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years. This is TED, and I want to talk about design. Because what I've been doing for the last four years -- really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion -- and in the last four years, I've been working just about non-stop on this topic. And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions. Now that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people, or anger, or anxiety of one sort or another. And that is the spell that I want to break.\n","I want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon. We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena, like global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore. Today's religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed. They are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering. And, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design -- designed by natural selection itself -- and intelligent design -- more or less intelligent design -- and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions.\n","You don't do book talks at TED, but I'm going to have just one slide about my book, because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear. And I would be very interested to get your responses to this. It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book, at this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make. And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.\n","Here's my proposal, I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it: Education on world religions for all of our children -- in primary school, in high school, in public schools, in private schools and in home schooling. So what I'm proposing is, just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history, so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history, about their creeds, about their texts, their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements. And this should be presented factually, straightforwardly, with no particular spin, to all of the children in the country. And as long as you teach them that, you can teach them anything else you like. That, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom. As long as you inform your children about other religions, then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like -- teach them whatever creed you want them to learn. But also let them know about other religions.\n","Now, why do I say that? Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship. Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy. Misinformed consent is not worth it. It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really. Democracy depends on informed consent. This is the way we treat people as responsible adults. Now, children below the age of consent are a special case. Parents -- I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used -- parents are stewards of their children. They don't own them. You can't own your children. You have a responsibility to the world, to the state, to them, to take care of them right. You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important, but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world, too.\n","The reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this. One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it \"totalitarian.\" It strikes me as practically libertarian. Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic? I don't think so. All I'm saying is -- and facts, facts only; no values, just facts -- about all the world's religions. Another reviewer called it \"hilarious.\" Well, I'm really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hilarious. It seems to me to be such a plausible, natural extension of the democratic principles we already have that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous. I know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths. I don't think that's defensible. But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that -- any reactions to that -- later.\n","But now I'm going to move on. Back to the cow. This picture, which I pulled off the web -- the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture. That's the steward. Cows couldn't live without human stewards -- they're domesticated. They're a sort of ectosymbiont. They depend on us for their survival. And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep. I'm going to talk about sheep, too. There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here. How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!\n","(Laughter)\n","Think of what this got them. They could outsource all their problems: protection from predators, food-finding ...\n","(Laughter)\n","... health maintenance.\n","(Laughter)\n","The only cost in most flocks -- not even this -- a loss of free mating. What a deal! \"How clever of sheep!\" you might say. Except, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness. We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they're not very smart. It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all. They were clueless. But it was a very clever move. Whose clever move was it? It was the clever move of natural selection itself.\n","Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson, once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy, and Orgel's Second Rule is: Evolution is cleverer than you are. Now, that is not Intelligent Design -- not from Francis Crick. Evolution is cleverer than you are. If you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.\n","The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant. Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered. But the process itself is without purpose, without foresight, without design. When I was here four years ago, I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass. And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to reproduce. So it was sort of a spooky story.\n","And I think some people may have misunderstood. Lancet flukes aren't smart. I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there, somewhere between petunia and carrot. They're not really bright. They don't have to be. The lesson we learn from this is: you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary. The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head. It doesn't have to be. That's the way evolution works. Question: Was domestication good for sheep? It was great for their genetic fitness.\n","And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago. Here's what he said: \"Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of agriculture, human population, plus livestock and pets, was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.\" That was just 10,000 years ago. Yesterday, in biological terms. What is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us? 98 percent. That is what we have done on this planet.\n","Now, I talked to Paul afterwards -- I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth -- and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this. And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you: \"Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature -- have grown in population, technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.\" We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish. Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet. And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush. And how can we do that?\n","The key to our domination of the planet is culture. And the key to culture is religion. Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth. They would be puzzled by many things. Anybody know what this is? I'll tell you what it is. This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001, perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever, as seen from satellite photograph. Here's a big crowd. Here's another crowd in Mecca. Martians would be amazed by this. They'd want to know how it originated, what it was for and how it perpetuates itself.\n","Actually, I'm going to pass over this. The ant isn't alone. There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which -- in that case -- A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat. And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless, so it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat. True story. In other words, we have these hijackers -- you've seen this slide before, from four years ago -- a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior, on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness.\n","Does that ever happen to us? Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully. The Arabic word \"Islam\" means \"submission.\" It means \"surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah.\" But I'm not just talking about Islam. I'm talking also about Christianity. This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall 50 years ago. And on it, it says, in Latin: \"Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus.\" The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ. Same idea. Well, not quite. But in fact, Christians, too ... glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God. I'll give you a few quotes. \"The heart of worship is surrender. Surrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense.\" Those words are by Rick Warren. Those are from \"The Purpose Driven Life.\"\n","And I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read. You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man. And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually a brilliant book. First of all, the goal -- and you heard just now what the goal is -- it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded. Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal. He's absolutely right. There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life, and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal. I give him an A+ on this.\n","(Laughter)\n","Is the goal achieved? Yes. Thirty million copies of this book. Al Gore, eat your heart out.\n","(Laughter)\n","Just exactly what Al is trying to do, Rick is doing. This is a fantastic achievement. And the means -- how does he do it?\n","It's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes -- updating them, quietly dropping obsolete features, putting new interpretations on other features. This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years, and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it. I don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man. Excellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page. Moreover, he invites us to look under the hood. I really appreciated that. For instance, he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible verses. The book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted. Just enough repetition. That's really important. Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain. Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.\n","(Laughter)\n","With me, everybody --\n","(Audience and Dan Dennett) Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.\n","Thank you.\n","And now we come to my problem. Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book. But I wish it were better. I have some problems with the book. And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems. I wish he could do this with a revision, a Mark 2 version of his book. \"The truth will set you free.\" That's what it says in the Bible, and it's something that I want to live by, too.\n","My problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true. Now some of this is a difference of opinion. And that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning. Here's a passage -- it's very much what he said, anyway: \"If there was no God we would all be accidents, the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe. You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance. There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth.\" Now, I just do not believe that. By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim. Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong. We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us. But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion. That's not what I'm really worried about.\n","How about this: \"God designed this planet's environment just so we could live in it.\" I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean that we don't have to do the sorts of things that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do. I am not happy with that sentiment at all. And then I find this: \"All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose, a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.\" Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist. And here, I think, \"Wait a minute.\" I read this again. I read it three or four times and I think, \"Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design? Is he endorsing creationism here?\" And you can't tell. So I'm sort of thinking, \"Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet.\"\n","But then I read on, and I read this: \"First, Noah had never seen rain, because prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up.\" I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false. And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet, after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years, discourages people from scientific understanding. Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.\n","Here's one: \"God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your ministry unique. He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you.\" I think that's false. Now, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical. Here's another one: \"For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts. Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second.\" Well, it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that. There might be some way of treating that as true. \"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge, hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being -- an inbuilt need to connect with God.\" Well, the sense of which I agree with him, except I think it has an evolutionary explanation.\n","And what I find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral, if you want to have meaning in your life, you have to be an Intelligent Designer, you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection. And I think, on the contrary, that it is very important to solving the world's problems that we take evolutionary biology seriously. Whose truth are we going to listen to? Well, this is from \"The Purpose Driven Life\": \"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life: the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions, and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.\" Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?\n","And here's one that does concern me. Remember I quoted him before with this line: \"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense.\" And that's a problem.\n","(Sighs)\n","\"Don't ever argue with the Devil. He's better at arguing than you are, having had thousands of years to practice.\" Now, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move. It's an old move. It's a very clever adaptation of religions. It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism. \"You don't like my interpretation? You've got a reasonable objection to it? Don't listen, don't listen! That's the Devil speaking.\" This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship it seems to me that we want to have.\n","I've got one more problem, then I'm through. And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it. \"In the Great Commission, Jesus said, 'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples. Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teach them to do everything I've told you.'\" The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world. We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so. Here's one, not as beautiful as the others; it simply shows the religions of the world. Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.\n","Do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions, when their holy books are telling them, \"Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!\"? It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship to get on for the future. I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently, in front of a church: \"Good without God becomes zero.\" Sort of cute. A very clever little meme. I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is -- not in this guise, but in general -- is itself one of the main problems that we face.\n","If you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged atheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God. And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works. So, I wish we could drop this meme. I wish this meme would go extinct.\n","Thanks very much for your attention.\n","(Applause)</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2077\">\n","  <head>\n","    <url>http://www.ted.com/talks/rick_warren_on_a_life_of_purpose</url>\n","    <pagesize>79334</pagesize>\n","    <dtime>Thu Jan 28 17:36:49 CET 2016</dtime>\n","    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>\n","    <content-type>text/html; charset=utf-8</content-type>\n","    <keywords>talks, Christianity, God, TED Conference, culture, happiness, leadership, motivation, philanthropy, religion</keywords>\n","    <speaker>Rick Warren</speaker>\n","    <talkid>71</talkid>\n","    <videourl>http://download.ted.com/talks/RickWarren_2006.mp4</videourl>\n","    <videopath>talks/RickWarren_2006.mp4</videopath>\n","    <date>2006/02/25</date>\n","    <title>Rick Warren: A life of purpose</title>\n","    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Pastor Rick Warren, author of The Purpose-Driven Life, reflects on his own crisis of purpose in the wake of his book's wild success.

   <seekvideo id=\"180564\">Good for you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"184450\">When the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"188355\">I kind of had my little crisis.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"191386\">And that was: What is the purpose of this?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"195771\">Because it brought in enormous amounts of money.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"198580\">When you write the best-selling book in the world,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"201025\">it's tons and tons of money.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"203894\">And it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"207193\">When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"210609\">I started it with one other family in 1980.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"215674\">And I decided that I was never going to go on TV,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"218000\">because I didn't want to be a celebrity.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"219946\">I didn't want to be a, quote, \"evangelist, televangelist\" --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"223151\">that's not my thing.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"225896\">And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"230194\">I don't think --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"231758\">now, this is a worldview,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"233023\">and I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"236037\">Everybody's betting their life on something.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"238120\">You're betting your life on something,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"239981\">you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"243409\">So, everybody's betting their life on something.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"246658\">And when I, you know, made a bet,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"250644\">I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"254159\">And I believe in a pluralistic society,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"257142\">everybody's betting on something.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"260404\">And when I started the church,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"263526\">you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"268171\">And then when I wrote this book,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"270052\">and all of a sudden, it just took off,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"274601\">and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"277212\">Because as I started to say,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"278957\">I don't think you're given money or fame</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"281177\">for your own ego, ever.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"284511\">I just don't believe that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"286371\">And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"289582\">\"It's not about you,\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"292028\">then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"295432\">you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"298664\">That's kind of a no-brainer.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"301251\">So, what is it for?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"303743\">And I began to think about what I call the \"stewardship of affluence\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"307373\">and the \"stewardship of influence.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"310434\">So I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"314000\">That if you are a leader in any area --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"316449\">in business, in politics, in sports, in art,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"319989\">in academics, in any area --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"322081\">you don't own it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"324764\">You are a steward of it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"326909\">For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"330004\">This is not my planet.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"331588\">It wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"335075\">I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"338270\">I was debating the other day on a talk show,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"342391\">and the guy was challenging me and he'd go,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"344428\">\"What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"347856\">And I asked this guy, I said, \"Well, do you believe</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"351657\">that human beings are responsible</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"355564\">to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"359349\">Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"364334\">And he said, \"No.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"366285\">I said, \"Oh, you don't?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"367463\">I said, \"Let me make this clear again:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"369312\">Do you believe that as human beings -- I'm not talking about religion --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"373282\">do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"376178\">to take care of this planet,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"377544\">and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"380491\">And he said, \"No. Not any more than any other species.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"385200\">When he said the word \"species,\" he was revealing his worldview.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"389382\">And he was saying,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"390600\">\"I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"395887\">Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"398501\">but you're not a duck.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"400635\">You're not a duck.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"402543\">And you are responsible -- that's my worldview.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"406397\">And so, you need to understand what your worldview is.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"410696\">The problem is most people never really think it through.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"414783\">They never really ...</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"418746\">codify it or qualify it or quantify it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"422103\">and say, \"This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"426209\">I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"430159\">But you may, you may.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"433000\">Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"437113\">because it determines your decisions;</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"439859\">it determines your relationships;</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"442272\">it determines your level of confidence.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"445082\">It determines, really, everything in your life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"448277\">What we believe, obviously --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"450078\">and you know this -- determines our behavior,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"452809\">and our behavior determines what we become in life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"458912\">So all of this money started pouring in,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"461000\">and all of this fame started pouring in.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"465000\">And I'm going, what do I do with this?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"468539\">My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"473081\">We said, \"First, we're not going to use it on ourselves.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"477750\">I didn't go out and buy a bigger house.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"480099\">I don't own a guesthouse.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"481898\">I still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"485619\">We just said, we're not going to use it on us.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"488659\">The second thing was,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"491354\">I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"495282\">Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"498045\">over the last 25 years, and I gave it back.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"501710\">And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"504424\">that I do what I do for money -- I don't.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"506756\">In fact, personally, I've never met</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"510424\">a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"513840\">I know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"516919\">Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"520763\">Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"524605\">I left late today -- I'd hoped to be here yesterday --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"528073\">because my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"531547\">before he dies of cancer.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"533286\">And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"536000\">he's now in his mid-80s -- and he's dying with peace.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"539980\">You know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"545555\">The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"550352\">And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"554394\">it makes a difference.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"556171\">It makes a difference what you believe.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"559509\">So, we gave it all back,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"563398\">and then we set up three foundations,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"566260\">working on some of the major problems of the world:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"568681\">illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases -- particularly HIV/AIDS --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"574555\">and set up these three foundations, and put the money into that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"578757\">The last thing we did is we became what I call \"reverse tithers.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"582535\">And that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"590071\">we started tithing.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"592939\">Now, that's a principle in the Bible</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"595052\">that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"598159\">give it away to help other people.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"600865\">So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"604885\">So, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"607407\">second year we went to 12 percent,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"609068\">and the third year we went to 13 percent,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"611838\">and on and on and on.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"614339\">Why did I do that?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"615569\">Because every time I give,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"617185\">it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"621217\">Materialism is all about getting -- get, get, get, get all you can,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"625845\">can all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"629599\">It's all about more, having more.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"633539\">And we think that the good life is actually looking good --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"637658\">that's most important of all --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"639173\">looking good, feeling good and having the goods.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"643754\">But that's not the good life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"645532\">I meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"649768\">If money actually made you happy,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"652000\">then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"654977\">And that I know, personally, I know, is not true.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"657883\">It's just not true.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"660000\">So, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"663855\">it's about being good and doing good.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"667102\">Giving your life away.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"669579\">Significance in life doesn't come from status,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"673271\">because you can always find somebody who's got more than you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"676178\">It doesn't come from sex.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"677718\">It doesn't come from salary.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"680304\">It comes from serving.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"682658\">It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"685403\">we find significance.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"687490\">That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"692000\">And so we began to give away,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"695000\">and now after 30 years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"697000\">my wife and I are reverse tithers -- we give away 90 percent and live on 10.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"702055\">That, actually, was the easy part.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"703949\">The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"707162\">Because I started getting all kinds of invitations.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"710327\">I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"714288\">on three different continents,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"716117\">and I won't go into that,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"718831\">but it was an amazing thing.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"721452\">And I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"725347\">that the book has brought?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"727801\">And, being a pastor, I started reading the Bible.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"731610\">There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"734403\">and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"738172\">When you read this prayer,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"740000\">it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"744023\">He says, \"God, I want you to make me famous.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"746583\">That's what he prays.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"748047\">He said, \"I want you to make me famous.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"749938\">I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"752795\">I want you to give me power.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"756130\">I want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"759769\">And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"763024\">if you were going to pray.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"765444\">Until you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"768117\">And then he says, \"So that the king ...\" --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"770759\">he was the king of Israel at that time, at its apex in power --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"775570\">\"... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"779333\">support the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"783361\">assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"787000\">those in prison.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"789000\">Basically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"792757\">And as I read that,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"794370\">I looked at it, and I thought, you know,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"797824\">what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"801795\">for those who have no influence.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"805763\">The purpose of influence is not to build your ego.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"810992\">Or your net worth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"812168\">And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"815844\">Your value is not based on your valuables.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"821000\">It's based on a whole different set of things.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"823732\">And so the purpose of influence is to speak up</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"826861\">for those who have no influence.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"828425\">And I had to admit:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"830363\">I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"833413\">They're not on my radar.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"836261\">I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"839473\">a bunch of gated communities.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"841354\">I have a church full of CEOs and scientists.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"845640\">And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"850000\">They're just not in my pathway.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"852379\">Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"856867\">So I had to say, ok,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"859000\">I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"862809\">to help those who don't have either of those.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"867610\">You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"870365\">whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"873968\">But Moses, if you saw the movie, \"The Ten Commandments,\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"876632\">Moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"879939\">and God says, \"Moses, what's in your hand?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"885261\">I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"889126\">What's in your hand?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"891416\">Moses says, \"It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"896000\">And God says, \"Throw it down.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"897890\">And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"904230\">And then God says, \"Pick it up.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"907152\">And he picks it back up again,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"909000\">and it becomes a staff again.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"912357\">Now, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"916143\">OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"919480\">Number one, God never does a miracle to show off.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"923091\">It's not just, \"Wow, isn't that cool?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"925158\">And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"928881\">You know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"932800\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"934017\">Ok? I just, this is why I love what Michael does,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"936916\">because it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"941598\">But God -- my God -- doesn't show up on sprinkler images.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"945760\">He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"950000\">But he doesn't do miracles just to show off.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"953106\">Second thing is, if God ever asks you a question,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"955429\">he already knows the answer.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"957682\">Obviously, if he's God, then that would mean</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"959923\">that when he asks the question, it's for your benefit, not his.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"963627\">So he's going, \"What's in your hand?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"965512\">Now, what was in Moses' hand?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"967000\">Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"971037\">This staff represented three things about Moses' life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"974466\">First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"978029\">It's the symbol of his own occupation:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"981352\">I am a shepherd.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"983219\">It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"986369\">Second, it's a symbol of not only his identity,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"989543\">it's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"993722\">In those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"998143\">Your assets are tied up in your flocks.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1001277\">So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1004983\">And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1008348\">What do you do with a shepherd's staff?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1011679\">Well, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1015456\">by hook or by crook.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1017121\">You pull them or you poke them. One or the other.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1021405\">So, he's saying,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1023357\">\"You're going to lay down your identity.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1025420\">What's in your hand?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1026599\">You've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1029496\">What's in your hand?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1031498\">And he's saying, \"If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1034451\">I'll do some things you could never imagine possible.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1037050\">And if you've watched that movie, \"Ten Commandments,\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1039568\">all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1046152\">Last year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1051940\">And so, I'm talking to the players,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1055000\">because most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1059325\">have done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1062508\">And I asked them, I said, \"What's in your hand?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1067392\">So, what's in your hand?\" I said, \"It's a basketball.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1071411\">And that basketball represents your identity, who you are:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1075152\">you're an NBA player.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1076650\">It represents your income:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1078246\">you're making a lot of money off that little ball.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1081182\">And it represents your influence.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1083645\">And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1086976\">you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1089787\">And that gives you enormous influence.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1092254\">So, what are you going to do with what you've been given?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1096785\">And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1101298\">to all of you very bright people at TED --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1104251\">it is to say, \"What's in your hand?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1108156\">What do you have that you've been given?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1112606\">Talent, background, education,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1116000\">freedom, networks, opportunities,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1120183\">wealth, ideas, creativity.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1123750\">What are you doing with what you've been given?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1127823\">That, to me, is the primary question about life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1131737\">That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1135999\">In the book, I talk about how you're wired to do certain things,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1139227\">you're \"SHAPED\" with -- a little acrostic: Spiritual gifts, Heart,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1142920\">Ability, Personality and Experiences.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1145332\">These things shape you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1147420\">And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1150568\">you need to look at your shape -- \"What am I wired to do?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1153329\">Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1156671\">If you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1159943\">If you're wired to be an undersea explorer,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1161975\">you'll be an undersea explorer.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1163491\">If you're wired to make deals, you make deals.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1165681\">If you're wired to paint, you paint.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1168355\">Did you know that God smiles when you be you?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1172574\">When my little kids -- when my kids were little --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1174945\">they're all grown now, I have grandkids --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1176976\">I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1179312\">and I used to watch my kids sleep.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1182152\">And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1187622\">And I would look at them: \"This is not an accident.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1190501\">Rise and lower.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1193247\">And I got joy out of just watching them sleep.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1199000\">Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1202591\">when you're doing, quote, \"spiritual things,\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1204735\">like going to church or helping the poor,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1207472\">or, you know, confessing or doing something like that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1211420\">The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1215802\">Why? He made you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1217890\">And when you do what you were made to do,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1220311\">he goes, \"That's my boy! That's my girl!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1224382\">You're using the talent and ability that I gave you.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1228513\">So my advice to you is:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1230417\">look at what's in your hand --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1232171\">your identity, your influence, your income --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1236861\">and say, \"It's not about me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1239388\">It's about making the world a better place.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1243434\">Thank you.</seekvideo>\n","    </transcription>\n","    <wordnum>3468</wordnum>\n","    <charnum>18050</charnum>\n","  </head>\n","  <content>I'm often asked, \"What surprised you about the book?\" And I say, \"That I got to write it.\" I would have never imagined that. Not in my wildest dreams did I think -- I don't even consider myself to be an author. And I'm often asked, \"Why do you think so many people have read this? This thing's selling still about a million copies a month.\"\n","And I think it's because spiritual emptiness is a universal disease. I think inside at some point, we put our heads down on the pillow and we go, \"There's got to be more to life than this.\" Get up in the morning, go to work, come home and watch TV, go to bed, get up in the morning, go to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed, go to parties on weekends. A lot of people say, \"I'm living.\" No, you're not living -- that's just existing. Just existing. I really think that there's this inner desire. I do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident. Your parents may not have planned you, but I believe God did. I think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that. I don't think there are accidental kids. And I think you matter.\n","I think you matter to God; I think you matter to history; I think you matter to this universe. And I think that the difference between what I call the survival level of living, the success level of living, and the significance level of living is: Do you figure out, \"What on Earth am I here for?\" I meet a lot of people who are very smart, and say, \"But why can't I figure out my problems?\" And I meet a lot of people who are very successful, who say, \"Why don't I feel more fulfilled? Why do I feel like a fake? Why do I feel like I've got to pretend that I'm more than I really am?\" I think that comes down to this issue of meaning, of significance, of purpose. I think it comes down to this issue of: \"Why am I here? What am I here for? Where am I going?\" These are not religious issues. They're human issues.\n","I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke that I really appreciate what he does, because it makes my life work a whole lot easier. As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks. And I have learned that there are kooks in every area of life. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that, but there are plenty of religious kooks. There are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks. There are people -- a lady came up to me the other day, and she had a white piece of paper -- Michael, you'll like this one -- and she said, \"What do you see in it?\" And I looked at it and I said, \"Oh, I don't see anything.\" And she goes, \"Well, I see Jesus,\" and started crying and left. I'm going, \"OK,\" you know? \"Fine.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Good for you.\n","When the book became the best-selling book in the world for the last three years, I kind of had my little crisis. And that was: What is the purpose of this? Because it brought in enormous amounts of money. When you write the best-selling book in the world, it's tons and tons of money. And it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted. When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old. I started it with one other family in 1980. And I decided that I was never going to go on TV, because I didn't want to be a celebrity. I didn't want to be a, quote, \"evangelist, televangelist\" -- that's not my thing. And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention. I don't think -- now, this is a worldview, and I will tell you, everybody's got a worldview.\n","Everybody's betting their life on something. You're betting your life on something, you just better know why you're betting what you're betting on. So, everybody's betting their life on something. And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was. And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something. And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now. And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this? Because as I started to say, I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego, ever. I just don't believe that. And when you write a book that the first sentence of the book is, \"It's not about you,\" then, when all of a sudden it becomes the best-selling book in history, you've got to figure, well, I guess it's not about me. That's kind of a no-brainer. So, what is it for?\n","And I began to think about what I call the \"stewardship of affluence\" and the \"stewardship of influence.\" So I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship. That if you are a leader in any area -- in business, in politics, in sports, in art, in academics, in any area -- you don't own it. You are a steward of it. For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment. This is not my planet. It wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die, I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.\n","I was debating the other day on a talk show, and the guy was challenging me and he'd go, \"What's a pastor doing on protecting the environment?\" And I asked this guy, I said, \"Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation? Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?\" And he said, \"No.\" I said, \"Oh, you don't?\" I said, \"Let me make this clear again: Do you believe that as human beings -- I'm not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility to take care of this planet, and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?\" And he said, \"No. Not any more than any other species.\" When he said the word \"species,\" he was revealing his worldview. And he was saying, \"I'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is.\" Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks, but you're not a duck. You're not a duck. And you are responsible -- that's my worldview. And so, you need to understand what your worldview is.\n","The problem is most people never really think it through. They never really ... codify it or qualify it or quantify it, and say, \"This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe.\" I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist. But you may, you may. Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence. It determines, really, everything in your life. What we believe, obviously -- and you know this -- determines our behavior, and our behavior determines what we become in life.\n","So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in. And I'm going, what do I do with this? My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money. We said, \"First, we're not going to use it on ourselves.\" I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I don't own a guesthouse. I still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven. We just said, we're not going to use it on us. The second thing was, I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor. Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years, and I gave it back. And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don't. In fact, personally, I've never met a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money. I know that's the stereotype; I've never met one of them. Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.\n","Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call, they're like doctors. I left late today -- I'd hoped to be here yesterday -- because my father-in-law is in his last, probably, 48 hours before he dies of cancer. And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life -- he's now in his mid-80s -- and he's dying with peace. You know, the test of your worldview is not how you act in the good times. The test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral. And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals, it makes a difference. It makes a difference what you believe.\n","So, we gave it all back, and then we set up three foundations, working on some of the major problems of the world: illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases -- particularly HIV/AIDS -- and set up these three foundations, and put the money into that. The last thing we did is we became what I call \"reverse tithers.\" And that is, when my wife and I got married 30 years ago, we started tithing. Now, that's a principle in the Bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity, give it away to help other people. So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent. So, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent, second year we went to 12 percent, and the third year we went to 13 percent, and on and on and on. Why did I do that? Because every time I give, it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.\n","Materialism is all about getting -- get, get, get, get all you can, can all you get, sit on the can and spoil the rest. It's all about more, having more. And we think that the good life is actually looking good -- that's most important of all -- looking good, feeling good and having the goods. But that's not the good life. I meet people all the time who have those, and they're not necessarily happy. If money actually made you happy, then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest. And that I know, personally, I know, is not true. It's just not true.\n","So, the good life is not about looking good, feeling good or having the goods, it's about being good and doing good. Giving your life away. Significance in life doesn't come from status, because you can always find somebody who's got more than you. It doesn't come from sex. It doesn't come from salary. It comes from serving. It is in giving our lives away that we find meaning, we find significance. That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God. And so we began to give away, and now after 30 years, my wife and I are reverse tithers -- we give away 90 percent and live on 10. That, actually, was the easy part. The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention? Because I started getting all kinds of invitations. I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour on three different continents, and I won't go into that, but it was an amazing thing. And I'm going, what do I do with this notoriety that the book has brought?\n","And, being a pastor, I started reading the Bible. There's a chapter in the Bible called Psalm 72, and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence. When you read this prayer, it sounds incredibly selfish, self-centered. He says, \"God, I want you to make me famous.\" That's what he prays. He said, \"I want you to make me famous. I want you to spread the fame of my name through every land, I want you to give me power. I want you to make me famous, I want you to give me influence.\" And it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make, if you were going to pray. Until you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter. And then he says, \"So that the king ...\" -- he was the king of Israel at that time, at its apex in power -- \"... so that the king may care for the widow and orphan, support the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick, assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner, those in prison.\" Basically, he's talking about all the marginalized in society.\n","And as I read that, I looked at it, and I thought, you know, what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. The purpose of influence is not to build your ego. Or your net worth. And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth. Your value is not based on your valuables. It's based on a whole different set of things. And so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence. And I had to admit: I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans. They're not on my radar. I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America -- a bunch of gated communities. I have a church full of CEOs and scientists. And I could go five years and never, ever see a homeless person. They're just not in my pathway. Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana. So I had to say, ok, I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those.\n","You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me. But Moses, if you saw the movie, \"The Ten Commandments,\" Moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him, and God says, \"Moses, what's in your hand?\" I think that's one of the most important questions you'll ever be asked: What's in your hand? Moses says, \"It's a staff. It's a shepherd's staff.\" And God says, \"Throw it down.\" And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake. And then God says, \"Pick it up.\" And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again. Now, I'm reading this thing, and I'm going, what is that all about? OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things. Number one, God never does a miracle to show off. It's not just, \"Wow, isn't that cool?\" And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread. You know, if God's going to show up, he's not going to show up on cheese bread.\n","(Laughter)\n","Ok? I just, this is why I love what Michael does, because it's like, if he's debunking it, then I don't have to. But God -- my God -- doesn't show up on sprinkler images. He's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do. But he doesn't do miracles just to show off.\n","Second thing is, if God ever asks you a question, he already knows the answer. Obviously, if he's God, then that would mean that when he asks the question, it's for your benefit, not his. So he's going, \"What's in your hand?\" Now, what was in Moses' hand? Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.\n","This staff represented three things about Moses' life. First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd. It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job. Second, it's a symbol of not only his identity, it's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep. In those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds. Your assets are tied up in your flocks. So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income. And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence. What do you do with a shepherd's staff? Well, you know, you move sheep from point A to point B with it, by hook or by crook. You pull them or you poke them. One or the other. So, he's saying, \"You're going to lay down your identity. What's in your hand? You've got identity, you've got income, you've got influence. What's in your hand?\" And he's saying, \"If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive. I'll do some things you could never imagine possible.\" And if you've watched that movie, \"Ten Commandments,\" all of those big miracles that happen in Egypt are done through this staff.\n","Last year, I was invited to speak at the NBA All-Stars game. And so, I'm talking to the players, because most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams have done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book. And I asked them, I said, \"What's in your hand? So, what's in your hand?\" I said, \"It's a basketball. And that basketball represents your identity, who you are: you're an NBA player. It represents your income: you're making a lot of money off that little ball. And it represents your influence. And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years, you're going to be an NBA player for the rest of your life. And that gives you enormous influence. So, what are you going to do with what you've been given?\"\n","And I guess that's the main reason I came up here today, to all of you very bright people at TED -- it is to say, \"What's in your hand?\" What do you have that you've been given? Talent, background, education, freedom, networks, opportunities, wealth, ideas, creativity. What are you doing with what you've been given? That, to me, is the primary question about life. That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about. In the book, I talk about how you're wired to do certain things, you're \"SHAPED\" with -- a little acrostic: Spiritual gifts, Heart, Ability, Personality and Experiences. These things shape you. And if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life, you need to look at your shape -- \"What am I wired to do?\" Why would God wire you to do something and then not have you do it? If you're wired to be an anthropologist, you'll be an anthropologist. If you're wired to be an undersea explorer, you'll be an undersea explorer. If you're wired to make deals, you make deals. If you're wired to paint, you paint.\n","Did you know that God smiles when you be you? When my little kids -- when my kids were little -- they're all grown now, I have grandkids -- I used to go in and sit on the side of their bed, and I used to watch my kids sleep. And I just watched their little bodies rise and lower, rise and lower. And I would look at them: \"This is not an accident.\" Rise and lower. And I got joy out of just watching them sleep. Some people have the misguided idea that God only gets excited when you're doing, quote, \"spiritual things,\" like going to church or helping the poor, or, you know, confessing or doing something like that. The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you. Why? He made you. And when you do what you were made to do, he goes, \"That's my boy! That's my girl! You're using the talent and ability that I gave you.\"\n","So my advice to you is: look at what's in your hand -- your identity, your influence, your income -- and say, \"It's not about me. It's about making the world a better place.\"\n","Thank you.</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2078\">\n","  <head>\n","    <url>http://www.ted.com/talks/julia_sweeney_on_letting_go_of_god</url>\n","    <pagesize>80878</pagesize>\n","    <dtime>Thu Jan 28 17:36:59 CET 2016</dtime>\n","    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>\n","    <content-type>text/html; charset=utf-8</content-type>\n","    <keywords>talks, Christianity, God, TED Conference, arts, atheism, comedy, culture, performance, religion, storytelling</keywords>\n","    <speaker>Julia Sweeney</speaker>\n","    <talkid>86</talkid>\n","    <videourl>http://download.ted.com/talks/JuliaSweeney_2006.mp4</videourl>\n","    <videopath>talks/JuliaSweeney_2006.mp4</videopath>\n","    <date>2006/02/24</date>\n","    <title>Julia Sweeney: Letting go of God</title>\n","    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Julia Sweeney (God Said, \"Ha!\") performs the first 15 minutes of her 2006 solo show Letting Go of God.

He was six.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"234277\">Well, I finally found Bill</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"235563\">about a block away from our house at this public school playground.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"238796\">It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"240936\">just kicking a ball against the side of a wall.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"243166\">I ran up to him and said, \"Bill!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"245000\">I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"248167\">and then you're capable of committing any and all sins</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"250737\">against God and man.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"251912\">And Bill said, \"So?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"253924\">And I said, \"So, you're six.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"255934\">You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"259996\">And he said, \"So?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"261762\">And I said, \"So? So everything!\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"265357\">And I turned to run. I was so angry with him.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"268206\">But when I got to the top of the steps,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"270104\">I turned around dramatically and said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"271945\">\"Oh, by the way, Bill -- there is no Santa Claus.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"275400\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"277352\">Now, I didn't know it at the time,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"279115\">but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"282285\">For my 13th birthday,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"283634\">I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"286229\">but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"289855\">\"I need to speak to you privately.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"293101\">September 10th is not your birthday. It's October 10th.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"297106\">And I said, \"What?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"298679\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"299718\">And she said ...</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"301003\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"302581\">\"Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15th.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"308000\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"309227\">\"So I told them that your birthday was September 10th,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"312068\">and then I wasn't sure</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"313243\">that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"316135\">so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"319841\">But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"324070\">I thought about it, and when I was four,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"326000\">I was already the oldest of four children,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"328024\">and my mother even had another child to come,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"330167\">so what I think she -- understandably -- really meant</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"332696\">was that she was so ready, she was so ready.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"335095\">Then she said, \"Don't worry, Julie.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"336793\">Every year on October 10th,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"338286\">when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"341160\">I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"344401\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"347252\">Which was comforting, but troubling.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"349570\">My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"353133\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"354165\">What was so upsetting about this new piece of information</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"357178\">was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"359877\">with all of my girlfriends.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"361203\">What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"365087\">I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"368186\">And I read my horoscope every single day,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"370783\">and it was so totally me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"373000\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"375000\">And this meant that I was a Libra?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"377753\">So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"381091\">The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"384512\">sort of lounging by some water,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"386068\">but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"388926\">This was around the time that I started filling out physically,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"391917\">and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"394924\">and frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"398652\">just seemed ominous and depressing.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"401000\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"404169\">But I got the new Libra poster,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"406000\">and I started to read my new Libra horoscope,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"409301\">and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"413751\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"415311\">It wasn't until years later, looking back</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"417316\">on this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"419999\">that it dawned on me:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"421310\">I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"423857\">I had a whole other month</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"425127\">to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"429238\">Oh, life can be so cruel.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"433317\">One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"437192\">Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"439852\">and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"442175\">for people who are peddling things door to door.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"444588\">Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"448000\">showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"450186\">And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"452450\">that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"455329\">if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"458556\">So normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"463000\">And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white, starched short-sleeved shirts,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"468309\">and they had little name tags</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"469793\">that identified them

message for me, from God.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"478629\">I said, \"A message for me? From God?\" And they said, \"Yes.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"483848\">Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"486000\">around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"489111\">I've worked with them and even dated them,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"491144\">but I never really knew the doctrine,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"492946\">or what they said to people when they were out on a mission,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"495782\">and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, \"Well, please, come in.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"499111\">And they looked really happy,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"500532\">because I don't think this happens to them all that often.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"503286\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"504317\">And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"518085\">Ok, I got it, I got it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"519664\">I got them glasses of water.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"521093\">Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"522943\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"525952\">You can't put a video of myself in front of me</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"529000\">and expect me not to fix my hair.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"530938\">Ok.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"532290\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"536401\">So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"538816\">and after niceties, they said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"540797\">\"Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"543433\">And I thought, \"Well, of course I believe in God,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"547000\">but you know, I don't like that word 'heart,'</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"549535\">because it anthropomorphizes God,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"552000\">and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"556677\">But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"559198\">so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"562903\">\"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"566862\">And they looked at each other and smiled,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"568862\">like that was the right answer.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"570957\">And then they said, \"Do you believe</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"572664\">that we're all brothers and sisters on this

quickly.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"579686\">And they said, \"Well, then we have a story to tell you.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"582801\">And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"586000\">who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"588907\">Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"593480\">Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"597000\">And God came to

them.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"604000\">He led them to America.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"607172\">I said, \"America?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo

\"Yes.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"617000\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"618879\">Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"621167\">reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"624066\">there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"627344\">and the Nephites were totally good -- each and every one of them --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"630818\">and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"633009\">every single one of them just bad to the bone.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"635184\">Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"638716\">on his way up to heaven,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"639907\">he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"642504\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"643554\">And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"647066\">each and every one of them --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"648472\">they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"651197\">But apparently somebody blew it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"653722\">because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"656483\">All but one guy, this guy named Mormon,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"658773\">who managed to survive by hiding in the woods.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"661543\">And he made sure this whole story was written down</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"664277\">in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"668669\">which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"671760\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"677259\">Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"680000\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"683366\">I said, \"What happened to the Lamanites?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"686242\">And they said, \"Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"690108\">And I said, \"So, you believe the Native Americans are descended</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"693318\">from a people who were totally evil?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"695383\">And they said, \"Yes.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"697627\">Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"700707\">found those buried gold plates right in his backyard,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"704366\">and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"708112\">and then buried his face into,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"709634\">and this allowed him to translate the gold plates</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"712018\">from the reformed Egyptian into English.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"714890\">Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"718289\">about their pitch.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"719742\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"722607\">I wanted

start --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"734376\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"736000\">telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"741138\">Then, they said, \"Do you believe that God speaks to us</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"743749\">through his righteous prophets?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"745313\">And I said, \"No, I don't,\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"746590\">because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"749099\">and this crazy gold plate story,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"750675\">but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"753533\">so I backpedaled a little and I said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"755755\">\"Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"758666\">And what do you mean by prophets?

But more importantly, being seven means that you've reached the age of reason, and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Now, I had heard this phrase, \"age of reason,\" before. Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second-grade class at school. But when she said it, the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession, and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil. And anyway, I hadn't really paid all that much attention to that phrase, \"age of reason.\" So, I said, \"Yeah, yeah, age of reason. What does that mean again?\" And my dad said, \"Well, we believe, in the Catholic Church, that God knows that little kids don't know the difference between right and wrong, but when you're seven, you're old enough to know better. So, you've grown up and reached the age of reason, and now God will start keeping notes on you, and begin your permanent record.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","And I said, \"Oh ... Wait a minute. You mean all that time, up till today, all that time I was so good, God didn't notice it?\" And my mom said, \"Well, I noticed it.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","And I thought, \"How could I not have known this before? How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me? All that being good and no real credit for it. And worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?\" So I said, \"Well, Mom and Dad, what about Santa Claus? I mean, Santa Claus knows if you're naughty or nice, right?\" And my dad said, \"Yeah, but, honey, I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\" And my mother said, \"Oh, Bob, stop it. Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven. Julie, there is no Santa Claus.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Now, this was actually not that upsetting to me. My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus: how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve, like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning, our family would give Santa more time. Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss. Which made me very suspicious. It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents. I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style, and my mother's handwriting was so close to Santa's.\n","(Laughter)\n","Plus, why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he'd gone to everybody else's? There was only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence: our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit, and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment, this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly -- but let's face it, he was also very judgmental. So to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief.\n","I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa, but rather, I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing. It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else, someone who could use the information. They had to fit two criteria: they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason, and not yet seven. The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six. Well, I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground. It was a Saturday, and he was all by himself, just kicking a ball against the side of a wall. I ran up to him and said, \"Bill! I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven, and then you're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man.\" And Bill said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So, you're six. You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God won't notice it.\" And he said, \"So?\" And I said, \"So? So everything!\" And I turned to run. I was so angry with him. But when I got to the top of the steps, I turned around dramatically and said, \"Oh, by the way, Bill -- there is no Santa Claus.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Now, I didn't know it at the time, but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th. For my 13th birthday, I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends, but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said, \"I need to speak to you privately. September 10th is not your birthday. It's October 10th.\" And I said, \"What?\"\n","(Laughter)\n","And she said ...\n","(Laughter)\n","\"Listen. The cut-off date to start kindergarten was September 15th.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","\"So I told them that your birthday was September 10th, and then I wasn't sure that you weren't just going to go blab it all over the place, so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th. But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready.\" I thought about it, and when I was four, I was already the oldest of four children, and my mother even had another child to come, so what I think she -- understandably -- really meant was that she was so ready, she was so ready. Then she said, \"Don't worry, Julie. Every year on October 10th, when it was your birthday but you didn't realize it, I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Which was comforting, but troubling. My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me, without me.\n","(Laughter)\n","What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I had to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends. What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo. I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom. And I read my horoscope every single day, and it was so totally me.\n","(Laughter)\n","And this meant that I was a Libra? So, I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster. The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair, sort of lounging by some water, but the Libra poster is just a huge scale. This was around the time that I started filling out physically, and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls, and frankly, the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing.\n","(Laughter)\n","But I got the new Libra poster, and I started to read my new Libra horoscope, and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me.\n","(Laughter)\n","It wasn't until years later, looking back on this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing, that it dawned on me: I wasn't turning seven when I thought I turned seven. I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me. Oh, life can be so cruel. One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door. Now, I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles, and my block is -- well, it's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door. Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven. And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they won't join a gang and just start robbing people, if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them. So normally, I just ignore the doorbell, but on this day, I answered. And there stood two boys, each about 19, in white, starched short-sleeved shirts, and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they said they had a message for me, from God. I said, \"A message for me? From God?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest, around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know, I've worked with them and even dated them, but I never really knew the doctrine, or what they said to people when they were out on a mission, and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, \"Well, please, come in.\" And they looked really happy, because I don't think this happens to them all that often.\n","(Laughter)\n","And I sat them down, and I got them glasses of water -- Ok, I got it, I got it. I got them glasses of water. Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.\n","(Laughter)\n","You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair. Ok.\n","(Laughter)\n","So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties, they said, \"Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?\" And I thought, \"Well, of course I believe in God, but you know, I don't like that word 'heart,' because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God.\" But I didn't want to argue semantics with these boys, so after a very long, uncomfortable pause, I said, \"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved.\" And they looked at each other and smiled, like that was the right answer. And then they said, \"Do you believe that we're all brothers and sisters on this planet?\" And I said, \"Yes, I do.\" And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly. And they said, \"Well, then we have a story to tell you.\"\n","And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi, who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC. Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC, everyone was completely bad and evil. Every single one of them: man, woman, child, infant, fetus. And God came to Lehi and said to him, \"Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here.\" And God did lead them. He led them to America. I said, \"America?\n","(Laughter)\n","From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC?\" And they said, \"Yes.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years, there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites, and the Nephites were totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone.\n","Then, after Jesus died on the cross for our sins, on his way up to heaven, he stopped by America and visited the Nephites.\n","(Laughter)\n","And he told them that if they all remained totally, totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil Lamanites. But apparently somebody blew it, because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites. All but one guy, this guy named Mormon, who managed to survive by hiding in the woods. And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates, which he then buried near Palmyra, New York.\n","(Laughter)\n","Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.\n","(Laughter)\n","I said, \"What happened to the Lamanites?\" And they said, \"Well, they became our Native Americans, here in the U.S.\" And I said, \"So, you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil?\" And they said, \"Yes.\" Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard, and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into, and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English.\n","Well, at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch.\n","(Laughter)\n","I wanted to say --\n","(Applause)\n","\"Ok, don't start with this story.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","I mean, even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start --\n","(Applause)\n","telling people all about Xenu, the evil intergalactic overlord. Then, they said, \"Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets?\" And I said, \"No, I don't,\" because I was sort of upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story, but the truth was, I hadn't really thought this through, so I backpedaled a little and I said, \"Well, what exactly do you mean by 'righteous'? And what do you mean by prophets? Like, could the prophets be women?\" And they said, \"No.\" And I said, \"Why?\" And they said, \"Well, it's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular, it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy.\" What is this wonderful gift God gave women, I wondered? Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt?\n","(Laughter)\n","Women's longer lifespan? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men? But no -- it wasn't any of these gifts. They said, \"Well, it's her ability to bear children.\" I said, \"Oh, come on. I mean, even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45, assuming they didn't die from exhaustion, it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God.\" And they said, \"No.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Well, then they didn't look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more, but they had more to say. They said, \"Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon, and if you're in good standing with the church, when you die, you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity.\" And I said, \"Oh, dear.\n","(Laughter)\n","That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","And they said, \"Oh.\n","(Laughter)\n","Hey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you in its best original state. Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back. Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see.\" I said, \"Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus, because I had cancer a few years ago. So does this mean that if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?\" And they said, \"Sure.\" And I said, \"I don't want it back. I'm happy without it.\" Gosh. What if you had a nose job and you liked it?\n","(Laughter)\n","Would God force you to get your old nose back? Then they gave me this Book of Mormon, told me to read this chapter and that chapter, and said they'd come back and check in on me, and I think I said something like, \"Please don't hurry,\" or maybe just, \"Please don't,\" and they were gone.\n","Ok, so I initially felt really superior to these boys, and smug in my more conventional faith. But then the more I thought about it, the more I had to be honest with myself. If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time, and they said, \"We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse, and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","\"And she had a baby, and that's the son of God,\" I mean, I would think that's equally ridiculous. I'm just so used to that story.\n","(Laughter)\n","So, I couldn't let myself feel condescending towards these boys. But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head: Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart? Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. Now, if they had asked me, \"Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart?\" Well, that would have been much different, I think I would have instantly answered, \"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time. I feel God's love when I'm hurt and confused, and I feel consoled and cared for. I take shelter in God's love when I don't understand why tragedy hits, and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see.\" But since they asked me that question with the word \"believe\" in it, somehow it was all different, because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2079\">\n","  <head>\n","    <url>http://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_prince_ramus_on_seattle_s_library</url>\n","    <pagesize>77004</pagesize>\n","    <dtime>Thu Jan 28 17:37:08 CET 2016</dtime>\n","    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>\n","    <content-type>text/html;

shoot; and you're bound to kill something.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"72365\">So, this is the promise of high modernism:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"74464\">within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"77711\">But as we're seeing,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"80000\">operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"83000\">in terms of design parameters.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"85063\">And so, with this sort of idea,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"86807\">what happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"90089\">or whatever seems to be the most immediate need,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"92376\">starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"95672\">of anything else could ever happen.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"97624\">And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"100245\">something that we call \"compartmentalized flexibility.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"104403\">And the idea is that you, within that continuum,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"106766\">identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"109918\">They can be pushed off-center a little bit,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"111959\">but in the end you actually still get as much</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"114096\">of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"117000\">With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"120463\">Now I'm going to talk about --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"121929\">I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"124262\">in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"127067\">and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"129908\">With the library staff and the library board,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"132236\">we settled on two core positions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"134000\">This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"137469\">the evolution of the book, and other technologies.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"141112\">This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"144000\">and our position was, books are technology --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"146540\">that's something people forget --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"148152\">but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"151338\">with any other form of truly potent technology or media.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"155130\">The second premise --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"156306\">and this was something that was very difficult for us</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"158821\">to convince the librarians of at first --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"160811\">is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"164618\">had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"167525\">Ok, now, this I'll come back to later, but something --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"170137\">actually, the librarians at first said, \"No, this isn't our mandate.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"173368\">Our mandate is media, and particularly the book.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"177463\">So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"180557\">The upper diagram is what we had seen</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"183033\">in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"187598\">Sort of, any activity could happen anywhere.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"190679\">We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book;</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"194405\">and so, we'll use this approach.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"196008\">And what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"199212\">not only were they very generic --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"200934\">so, not only does the reading room look like the copy room</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"203700\">look like the magazine area --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"205222\">but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"208972\">was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"212511\">And in this case, what was getting engulfed</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"214784\">were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"217824\">And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"220063\">Very dumb approach: simply compartmentalize.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"223174\">Put those things whose evolution we could predict --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"225651\">and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"229258\">but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"233168\">put those in boxes designed specifically for it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"235442\">and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"238160\">So that was the core idea.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"239431\">Now, we had to convince the library</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"241149\">that social roles were equally important to media,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"244839\">in order to get them to accept this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"246642\">What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"249666\">That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"253727\">Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"258039\">\"You know what? We haven't touched it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"260000\">but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"263411\">Two-thirds of it is already dedicated --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"265384\">that's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"268519\">is already dedicated to social functions.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"270552\">So once we had presented that back to them,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"272757\">they agreed that this sort of core concept could work.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"275352\">We got the right to go back to first principles --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"277730\">that's the third diagram.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"278964\">We recombined everything.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"280194\">And then we started making new decisions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"282176\">What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"285073\">specifically in terms of square footage.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"287018\">On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"292000\">sort of combs, collective programs.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"294000\">And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces;</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"296429\">things like reading rooms,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"297704\">whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"300413\">So that literally was the design of the building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"302746\">They signed it, and to their chagrin,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"304905\">we came back a week later, and we presented them this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"308000\">And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"310921\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"311946\">We just sized -- no, really, I mean that, literally.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"314400\">The things on the left-hand side of the diagram,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"316786\">those are the boxes.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"318000\">We sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"320953\">We had a very low budget to work with.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"322849\">We pushed them around on the site</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"324453\">to make very literal contextual relationships.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"326690\">The reading room should be able to see the water.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"329027\">The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"331832\">to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"334397\">So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"336874\">within each one, a very discrete thing is happening.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"339327\">The area in between is sort of an urban continuum,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"341698\">these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"345490\">To give you some sense of the power of this idea,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"348000\">the biggest block is what we call the book spiral.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"351000\">It's literally built in a very inexpensive way --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"353358\">it is a parking garage for books.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"356000\">It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"359511\">but that is not necessarily an expensive approach.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"362810\">And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"365660\">on one continuous run; no matter how it grows or contracts within the building,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"369555\">it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"374000\">that we've all experienced in public libraries.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"376753\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"378000\">And so this was the final operation,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"379755\">which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"382900\">and to hold onto them with a skin.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"385000\">That skin serves double duty, again, for economics.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"388000\">One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building;</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"391000\">it's a structural element.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"392286\">But its dimensions were designed not only for structure,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"394937\">but also for holding on every piece of glass.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"397212\">The glass was then -- I'll use the word impregnated --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"400000\">but it had a layer of metal that was called \"stretched metal.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"403436\">That metal acts as a microlouver,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"405298\">so from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"408703\">but from the interior, it's entirely transparent.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"411401\">So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"414871\">Let me see if I can find it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"416269\">For anyone who gets motion sickness, I apologize.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"420233\">So, this is the building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"424029\">And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"427910\">the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"432000\">And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"434866\">They said, \"Look, we don't know what it is,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"436914\">but we know it's everything that we need it to be,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"439303\">based on the observations that we've done about the program.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"445085\">This is going into one of the entries.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"447093\">So, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"454000\">So now we're going into what we call the living room.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"457625\">This is actually a program that we invented with the library.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"460521\">It was recognizing that public libraries</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"462462\">are the last vestige of public free space.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"465271\">There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"468723\">in downtown Seattle,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"469903\">but there are not so many free places</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"472854\">that allow you to get out of the rain.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"474699\">So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"478309\">including eat, yell, play chess and so forth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"480442\">Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"484472\">That was the main technology area in the building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"487424\">You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"494201\">And now up.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"500566\">This is actually the place that we put into the building</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"503219\">so I could propose to my wife, right there.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"505276\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"508000\">She said yes.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"509183\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"512593\">I'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"515198\">I can show this to you later.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"517000\">But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"520307\">because I think it's, as I said, the most --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"522395\">this is the main reading room -- the most unique part of the building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"526768\">You dizzy yet?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"529141\">Ok, so here, this is the book spiral.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"536395\">So, it's very indiscernible,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"538352\">but it's actually a continuous stair-stepping.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"541877\">It allows you to, on one city block,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"543893\">go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"551491\">Ok, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"555000\">I'm going to go very, very quickly through this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"557287\">Now this is the Dallas Theater.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"558991\">It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"562363\">\"We need you to do a new building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"564093\">We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"567543\">but because of that temporary space,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"569290\">we've become an infamous theater company.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"572177\">Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"575162\">with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"578283\">And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"581003\">meant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall;</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"583470\">they could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"587236\">So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"590292\">that could be a pristine building,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"592370\">but keep this kind of experimental nature.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"594413\">And the second is,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"595635\">they were what we call a multi-form theater,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"598537\">they do different kinds of performances in repertory.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"601167\">So they in the morning will do something in arena,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"604000\">then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"606517\">And so they needed to be able to quickly transform</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"608890\">between different theater organizations,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"610840\">and for operational budget reasons,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"612549\">this actually no longer happens in pretty much</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"614736\">any multi-form theater in the United States,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"617000\">so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"619499\">So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"622346\">to take those things that were previously defined</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"624680\">as front-of-house and back-of-house</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"626379\">and stack them above house and below house,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"628411\">and to create what we called a theater machine.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"630634\">We invest the money in the operation of the building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"633141\">It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"635987\">wherever you place it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"637163\">the area under it is charged for theatrical performances.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"639917\">And it allowed us to go back to first principles,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"642263\">and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"645869\">And at the push of a button,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"647363\">it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"651014\">and in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"654829\">in a very quick transfiguration.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"657248\">So in fact, using operational budget, we can --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"660694\">sorry, capital cost -- we can actually achieve</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"662910\">what was no longer achievable in operational cost.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"665898\">And that means that the artistic director</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"667875\">now has a palette that he or she can choose from,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"670264\">between a series of forms and a series of processions,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"673786\">because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"676934\">with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"680000\">So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"683293\">that enters in a Wagnerian procession,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"685432\">shows the first act in thrust,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"687791\">the intermission in a Greek procession,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"691000\">second act in arena, and so forth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"693254\">So I'm going to show you what this actually means.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"695629\">This is the theater up close.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"697421\">Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"702515\">The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"706437\">so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"710146\">Portions can be opened,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"711335\">so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"715002\">or you can even just have an open-air performance,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"717428\">or for intermissions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"719094\">The balconies all move to go between those configurations,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"721851\">but they also disappear.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"723517\">The proscenium line can also disappear.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"726129\">You can bring enormous objects in,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"727994\">so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"730009\">their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"732684\">and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"735000\">And then it also provides them, in the off-season,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"737635\">the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"744000\">This is it from a distance.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"748921\">Open up entire portions for different kinds of events.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"751933\">And at night.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"755092\">Again, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"759676\">This is a monster truck show.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"761578\">I'm going to show now the last project.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"763493\">This also is an unusual client.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"765000\">They inverted the whole idea of development.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"767497\">They came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"770348\">they said, \"We want to start out</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"771909\">by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"774682\">That's our main goal.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"775910\">And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"779529\">they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"782574\">And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"786178\">actually built their pro forma,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"787759\">so they worked in reverse.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"789431\">And that pro forma led us</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"791000\">to a mixed-use building that was very large,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"794000\">in order to support their aspirations of the art,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"796328\">but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"798899\">to collaborate, interact with commercial spaces</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"801143\">that actually artists more and more want to work within.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"804356\">And it also charged us with thinking about how to have</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"807405\">something that was both a single building</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"809393\">and a credible sort of sub-building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"812000\">So this is Louisville's skyline,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"814567\">and I'm going to take you through the various constraints</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"817271\">that led to the project.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"818488\">First: the physical constraints.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"820051\">We actually had to operate on three discrete sites,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"822476\">all of them well smaller than the size of the building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"825381\">We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"829088\">We had to operate within the 100-year floodplain.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"831410\">Now, this area floods three to four times a year,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"833749\">and there's a levee behind our site,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"835510\">similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"838687\">Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"842913\">a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"845853\">So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"850443\">Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"854699\">And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"857524\">that would link a series of cultural buildings,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"860498\">and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"863488\">that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"866060\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"867124\">And now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"870125\">And if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"873364\">these are the different programs --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"875060\">the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"879048\">and now we'd have a really terrible situation:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"881247\">a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"885000\">And then we would size all the other elements --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"887621\">the different commercial elements:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"889300\">hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"891467\">and dump it on top.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"892696\">And we would create something that was unviable.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"895684\">In fact -- and you know this -- this is called the Time Warner Building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"899453\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"901151\">So our strategy was very simple.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"903000\">Just lift the entire block,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"906135\">flip some of the elements over,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"907794\">reposition them so they have appropriate views</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"910628\">and relationships to downtown,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"912288\">and make circulation connections and reroute the road.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"915765\">So that's the basic concept,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"917316\">and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"920916\">Ok, it seems a very formal, willful gesture,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"923495\">but something derived entirely out of the constraints.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"926067\">And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"929072\">that this was about an architect making a statement,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"931533\">not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"935149\">Now, within that center zone, as I said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"937467\">we have the ability to mix a series of things.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"939646\">So here, this is sort of an x-ray --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"942393\">the towers are totally developer-driven.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"944352\">They told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"946826\">and we focused on taking all the public components --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"949347\">the lobbies, the bars --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"950663\">everything that different commercial elements would have,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"954000\">and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"957000\">in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"960742\">So it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"964831\">within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"968733\">but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"972214\">It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"975444\">or to see the art, and so forth.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"977143\">It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"980887\">they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"983621\">so they're not forced to always work within the confines</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"986282\">of a contemporary gallery space.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"987841\">So, how to build this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"989032\">It's very simple: it's a chair.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"991000\">So, we begin by building the cores.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"994456\">As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"998024\">That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1001114\">This is not a high-budget building.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1002839\">The moment the cores get to mid level,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1004712\">we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it;</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1007931\">and then we jack it up into the air.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1009700\">This is how they build really large aircraft hangars,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1012213\">for instance, the ones that they did for the A380.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1014597\">Finish the cores, finish the meat</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1016461\">and you get something that looks like this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1018498\">Now I only have about 30 seconds,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1020100\">so I want to start an animation,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1022022\">and we'll conclude with that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1023441\">Thank you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1024853\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1029000\">Chris asked me to add --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1031000\">the theater is under construction,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1032800\">and this project will start construction in about a year,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1035548\">and finish in 2010.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1036723\">[identify public elements]</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1038009\">[insert public elements at

<charnum>18688</charnum>\n","  </head>\n","  <content>I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire. I don't have much time to do it. And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.\n","The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process. It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call, sort of a rational conclusion to something. And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.\n","The second -- the second is that this process does not have a signature. There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship. This is something that has editing and it has teams, but in fact, we no longer see within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out.\n","And the third is that it challenges -- and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why, connect all these things -- but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility. High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic, almost anything can happen within them. I call it sort of \"shotgun flexibility\" -- turn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something. So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen. But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters. And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to be the most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen. And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call \"compartmentalized flexibility.\" And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them. They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped. With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.\n","Now I'm going to talk about -- I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see. With the library staff and the library board, we settled on two core positions. This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book, and other technologies. This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book, and our position was, books are technology -- that's something people forget -- but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media.\n","The second premise -- and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -- is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles. Ok, now, this I'll come back to later, but something -- actually, the librarians at first said, \"No, this isn't our mandate. Our mandate is media, and particularly the book.\"\n","So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building. The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility. Sort of, any activity could happen anywhere. We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book; and so, we'll use this approach.\n","And what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse -- not only were they very generic -- so, not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area -- but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it. And in this case, what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book. And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram. Very dumb approach: simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict -- and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future -- put those in boxes designed specifically for it, and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops. So that was the core idea.\n","Now, we had to convince the library that social roles were equally important to media, in order to get them to accept this. What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left. That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory. Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, \"You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books. Two-thirds of it is already dedicated -- that's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important -- is already dedicated to social functions.\" So once we had presented that back to them, they agreed that this sort of core concept could work. We got the right to go back to first principles -- that's the third diagram. We recombined everything. And then we started making new decisions.\n","What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage. On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs, collective programs. And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict. So that literally was the design of the building. They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this. And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.\n","(Laughter)\n","We just sized -- no, really, I mean that, literally. The things on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes. We sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with. We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships. The reading room should be able to see the water. The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.\n","So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes. within each one, a very discrete thing is happening. The area in between is sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree. To give you some sense of the power of this idea, the biggest block is what we call the book spiral. It's literally built in a very inexpensive way -- it is a parking garage for books. It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building, but that is not necessarily an expensive approach. And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System on one continuous run; no matter how it grows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries.\n","(Laughter)\n","And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin. That skin serves double duty, again, for economics. One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building; it's a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure, but also for holding on every piece of glass. The glass was then -- I'll use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metal that was called \"stretched metal.\" That metal acts as a microlouver, so from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior, it's entirely transparent.\n","So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building. Let me see if I can find it. For anyone who gets motion sickness, I apologize. So, this is the building. And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building, the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego. And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians. They said, \"Look, we don't know what it is, but we know it's everything that we need it to be, based on the observations that we've done about the program.\" This is going into one of the entries. So, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.\n","So now we're going into what we call the living room. This is actually a program that we invented with the library. It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space. There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain. So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell, play chess and so forth.\n","Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber. That was the main technology area in the building. You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you. And now up. This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife, right there.\n","(Laughter)\n","She said yes.\n","(Laughter)\n","I'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop. I can show this to you later. But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral, because I think it's, as I said, the most -- this is the main reading room -- the most unique part of the building. You dizzy yet? Ok, so here, this is the book spiral. So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually a continuous stair-stepping. It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.\n","Ok, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project. I'm going to go very, very quickly through this. Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said, \"We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company. Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company.\" And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall; they could do \"Cherry Orchard\" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.\n","So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature. And the second is, they were what we call a multi-form theater, they do different kinds of performances in repertory. So they in the morning will do something in arena, then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth. And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the United States, so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.\n","So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head: to take those things that were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them above house and below house, and to create what we called a theater machine. We invest the money in the operation of the building. It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere, wherever you place it, the area under it is charged for theatrical performances. And it allowed us to go back to first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth. And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust, and in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor, in a very quick transfiguration.\n","So in fact, using operational budget, we can -- sorry, capital cost -- we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost. And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from, between a series of forms and a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated. So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession, shows the first act in thrust, the intermission in a Greek procession, second act in arena, and so forth.\n","So I'm going to show you what this actually means. This is the theater up close. Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely. The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop. Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance, or you can even just have an open-air performance, or for intermissions. The balconies all move to go between those configurations, but they also disappear. The proscenium line can also disappear. You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company -- their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft. And then it also provides them, in the off-season, the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things. This is it from a distance. Open up entire portions for different kinds of events. And at night. Again, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure. This is a monster truck show.\n","I'm going to show now the last project. This also is an unusual client. They inverted the whole idea of development. They came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said, \"We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal.\" And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown. And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse. And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large, in order to support their aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate, interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within. And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building.\n","So this is Louisville's skyline, and I'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project. First: the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well smaller than the size of the building. We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it. We had to operate within the 100-year floodplain. Now, this area floods three to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site, similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans. Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites. So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub. Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines. And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add, that would link a series of cultural buildings, and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building.\n","(Laughter)\n","And now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet. And if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet -- these are the different programs -- the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a really terrible situation: a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods. And then we would size all the other elements -- the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth -- and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable. In fact -- and you know this -- this is called the Time Warner Building.\n","(Laughter)\n","So our strategy was very simple. Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections and reroute the road. So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.\n","Ok, it seems a very formal, willful gesture, but something derived entirely out of the constraints. And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement, not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems. Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix a series of things. So here, this is sort of an x-ray -- the towers are totally developer-driven. They told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth, and we focused on taking all the public components -- the lobbies, the bars -- everything that different commercial elements would have, and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.\n","So it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close. It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen, or to see the art, and so forth. It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool, so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space.\n","So, how to build this. It's very simple: it's a chair. So, we begin by building the cores. As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade. That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency. This is not a high-budget building. The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air. This is how they build really large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones that they did for the A380. Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something that looks like this.\n","Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that.\n","Thank you.\n","(Applause)\n","Chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction, and this project will start construction in about a year, and finish in 2010.\n","[identify public elements]\n","[insert public elements at grade]\n","[optimize tower dimensions]\n","[place towers on site]\n","[lift program]\n","[flip!]\n","[optimize program adjacencies]\n","[connect to context]\n","[redirect 7th street]</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2080\">\n","  <head>\n","    <url>http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen</url>\n","    <pagesize>88759</pagesize>\n","    <dtime>Thu Jan 28 17:37:18 CET 2016</dtime>\n","    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>\n","    <content-type>text/html; charset=utf-8</content-type>\n","    <keywords>talks, Africa, Asia, Google, TED Conference, demo, development, economics, global issues, health, statistics</keywords>\n","    <speaker>Hans Rosling</speaker>\n","    <talkid>92</talkid>\n","    <videourl>http://download.ted.com/talks/HansRosling_2006.mp4</videourl>\n","    <videopath>talks/HansRosling_2006.mp4</videopath>\n","    <date>2006/02/22</date>\n","    <title>Hans Rosling: The best stats you've ever seen</title>\n","    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: You've never seen data presented like this.

That was after having spent about 20 years together with African institutions studying hunger in Africa, so I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in Swedish college systems -- so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pre-test when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: \"Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?\"\n","I put them together, so that in each pair of country, one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow, and I got happy, of course: a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. That means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course.\n","(Laughter)\n","But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees.\n","(Laughter)\n","Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas.\n","I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, that hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there.\n","(Laughter)\n","This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware.\n","We did this software which displays it like this: every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, \"What do you really think about the world?\" Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.\n","(Laughter)\n","And they said, \"The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is Western world and 'them' is Third World.\" \"And what do you mean with Western world?\" I said. \"Well, that's long life and small family, and Third World is short life and large family.\"\n","So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here: number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since 1962 -- 1960 about -- on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries up to about 70 years. And 1962, there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries: they had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. Are the students right? Is it still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives and live up there?\n","Let's see. We stopped the world then. This is all U.N. statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast.\n","(Laughter)\n","In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s: the imams start to promote family planning. They move up into that corner. And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world.\n","(Applause)\n","(Applause ends)\n","Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam. 1964. America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens: the data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year, the family planning started in Vietnam; they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting for longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war. If we don't look in the data, I think we all underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economical change.\n","Let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income.\n","We heard it in other forms. And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa. This is Africa. 10% the world population, most in poverty. This is OECD. The rich country. The country club of the U.N. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this Earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia.\n","And how did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? Then there was more of a hump. And we have most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle.\n","Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money.\n","But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it burst, the size of its country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there. Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar -- they could sell their textiles -- on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America.\n","There's a huge difference between Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday. It's a tremendous variation within Africa which we rarely often make -- that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture, same religion -- huge difference. Even between neighbors. Yemen, civil war. United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country.\n","Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently. And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.\n","And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. This is Mao Tse-tung. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world.\n","But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. And I can run it forward, like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower.\n","And if we move back again, here, and we put on trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past.\n","Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this. Now that's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this. The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [medicine] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this.\n","And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other non-governmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there, and the Internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively.\n","All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly-funded statistics. There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics.\n","(Laughter)\n","And this won't work.\n","(Applause)\n","So what is needed? We have the databases. It's not the new database you need. We have wonderful design tools, and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture which, linking data to design, we called Gapminder, from the London Underground, where they warn you, \"mind the gap.\" So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating U.N. data, some few U.N. organization.\n","Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world, but what we really need is, of course, a search function. A search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says, \"It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.\"\n","But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? The publicly-funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net. And one of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the present, new Head of U.N. Statistics, he doesn't say it's impossible. He only says, \"We can't do it.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","And that's a quite clever guy, huh?\n","(Laughter)\n","So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China, 1970. This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. And what has happened? What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States. Almost like a ghost, isn't it?\n","(Laughter)\n","It's pretty scary.\n","(Laughter)\n","But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the Internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axises, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating.\n","I end now with the world. There, the Internet is coming. The number of Internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the $100 computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy and will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data.\n","Thank you very much.\n","(Applause)</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2081\">\n","  <head>\n","    <url>http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_robbins_asks_why_we_do_what_we_do</url>\n","    <pagesize>82734</pagesize>\n","    <dtime>Thu Jan 28 17:37:27 CET 2016</dtime>\n","    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>\n","    <content-type>text/html; charset=utf-8</content-type>\n","    <keywords>talks, TED Conference, business, culture, entertainment, goal-setting, motivation, politics, potential, psychology</keywords>\n","    <speaker>Tony Robbins</speaker>\n","    <talkid>96</talkid>\n","    <videourl>http://download.ted.com/talks/TonyRobbins_2006.mp4</videourl>\n","    <videopath>talks/TonyRobbins_2006.mp4</videopath>\n","    <date>2006/02/02</date>\n","    <title>Tony Robbins: Why we do what we do</title>\n","    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Tony Robbins discusses the \"invisible forces\" that motivate everyone's actions -- and high-fives Al Gore in the front row.</description>\n","    <transcription>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"2000\">Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"5502\">My excitement is: I get a chance to give something back.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"8438\">My challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"12000\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"13649\">I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"15903\">I do more, obviously, I also coach people --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"18162\">but I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"20957\">Not just by learning principles,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"22586\">you got in it and you did it so often that it became real.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"25463\">The bottom line of why I'm here, besides being a crazy mofo, is that --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"28964\">I'm not here to motivate you, you don't need that, obviously.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"32727\">Often that's what people think I do,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"34774\">and it's the furthest thing from it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"36513\">What happens, though, is people say to me,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"38582\">\"I don't need any motivation.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"40075\">But that's not what I do.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"41641\">I'm the \"why\" guy.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"43532\">I want to know why you do what you do.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"45628\">What is your motive for action?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"48135\">What is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"51337\">Are you running the same pattern?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"53066\">Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"57002\">is the most important thing.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"58834\">I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"62437\">All of us here have great minds.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"64278\">Most of us here have great minds, right?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"66730\">We all know how to think.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"69114\">With our minds we can rationalize anything.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"71227\">We can make anything happen.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"72593\">I agree with what was described a few days ago,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"75395\">that people work in their self-interest.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"77746\">But we know that that's bullshit at times.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"80388\">You don't work in your self-interest all the time,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"82776\">because when emotion comes into it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"84667\">the wiring changes in the way it functions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"86734\">So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"90709\">especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"93892\">But I really want to know what's driving you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"96018\">What I would like to invite you to do</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"97900\">by the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"101430\">One: so that you can contribute more.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"103335\">And two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"106629\">but appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"109543\">that can stop some of the challenges that we face today.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"112490\">They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"116259\">because it's making us intersect.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"118069\">That intersection doesn't always create a view</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"120319\">of \"everybody now understands everybody,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"122529\">and everybody appreciates everybody.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"124917\">I've had an obsession basically for 30 years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"127532\">\"What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"131871\">What in their performance?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"133352\">I got hired to produce the result now.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"135554\">I've done it for 30 years.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"137074\">I get the phone call</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"138645\">when the athlete is burning down on national television,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"141411\">and they were ahead by five strokes</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"143121\">and now they can't get back on the course.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"145145\">I've got to do something right now or nothing matters.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"147855\">I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"150851\">I've got to do something.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"152322\">In 29 years, I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"156000\">It doesn't mean I won't some day, but I haven't yet.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"158528\">The reason is an understanding of these human needs.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"161928\">When I get those calls about performance, that's one thing.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"165063\">How do you make a change?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"166573\">I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"170592\">to do something beyond themselves.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"174126\">Maybe the real question is,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"176258\">I look at life and say there's two master lessons.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"178653\">One is: there's the science of achievement,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"180756\">which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"183550\">\"How do you take the invisible and make it visible,\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"186069\">How do you make your dreams happen?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"187810\">Your business, your contribution to society, money --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"190421\">whatever, your body, your family.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"192157\">The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"196517\">Because science is easy, right?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"198117\">We know the rules, you write the code and you get the results.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"201046\">Once you know the game, you just up the ante, don't you?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"204214\">But when it comes to fulfillment -- that's an art.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"206671\">The reason is, it's about appreciation and contribution.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"209891\">You can only feel so much by yourself.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"212000\">I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"215960\">how somebody's life changes</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"217540\">if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"220875\">Like all the resources they say they need.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"223023\">You gave not a 100-dollar computer, but the best computer.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"225833\">You gave them love, joy, were there to comfort them.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"228379\">Those people very often -- you know some of them --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"230999\">end up the rest of their life</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"232464\">with all this love, education, money and background</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"234913\">going in and out of rehab.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"237000\">Some people have been through ultimate pain,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"240000\">psychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"243399\">and not always, but often,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"245079\">they become some of the people that contribute the most to society.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"248307\">The question we've got to ask ourselves really is, what is it?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"252263\">What is it that shapes us?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"253630\">We live in a therapy culture.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"255265\">Most of us don't do that, but the culture's a therapy culture,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"258331\">the mindset that we are our past.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"260344\">And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"263000\">but most of society thinks biography is destiny.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"266202\">The past equals the future.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"267869\">Of course it does if you live there.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"269608\">But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"272300\">because you can know something intellectually</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"274518\">and then not use it, not apply it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"276920\">We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"280652\">When you ask people,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"283380\">have you failed to achieve something significant in your life?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"287277\">Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"289000\">TR: Thanks for the interaction on a high level there.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"292000\">But if you ask people, why didn't you achieve something?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"295000\">Somebody who's working for you, or a partner, or even yourself.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"298279\">When you fail to achieve, what's the reason people say?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"301399\">What do they tell you?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"302566\">Didn't have the knowledge, didn't have the money,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"306899\">didn't have the time, didn't have the technology.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"311160\">I didn't have the right manager.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"313018\">Al Gore: Supreme Court. TR: The Supreme Court.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"315731\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"317985\">(Applause) (Cheering)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"330000\">(Applause continues)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"332000\">TR: And --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"333079\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"336001\">What do all those, including the Supreme Court, have in common?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"339121\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"340519\">They are a claim to you missing resources, and they may be accurate.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"345343\">You may not have the money, or the Supreme Court,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"348000\">but that is not the defining factor.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"350000\">(Applause) (Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"356000\">And you correct me if I'm wrong.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"358714\">The defining factor is never resources; it's resourcefulness.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"362000\">And what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"364828\">is if you have emotion, human emotion,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"368064\">something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"372117\">at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"374732\">and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"377994\">Audience: Yeah!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"379075\">(Applause) (Cheering)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"383766\">How easy for me to tell him what he should do.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"386000\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"388000\">Idiot, Robbins.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"390911\">But I know when we watched the debate at that time,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"396191\">there were emotions that blocked people's ability</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"398502\">to get this man's intellect and capacity.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"400503\">And the way that it came across to some people on that day --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"403423\">because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"406822\">and I was upset.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"408189\">But there was emotion there.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"409652\">Do you know what I'm talking about?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"411381\">Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"412739\">TR: So, emotion is it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"413903\">And if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"417677\">If you're creative, playful, fun enough,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"419621\">can you get through to anybody, yes or no?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"421715\">If you don't have the money,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"423183\">but you're creative and determined, you find the way.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"425736\">This is the ultimate resource.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"427243\">But this is not the story that people tell us.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"429500\">They tell us a bunch of different stories.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"431600\">They tell us we don't have the resources, but ultimately,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"434333\">if you take a look here,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"435921\">they say, what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"439287\">He's broken my pattern, that son-of-a-bitch.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"441572\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"444923\">But I appreciated the energy, I'll tell you that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"447301\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"448402\">What determines your resources?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"449943\">We've said decisions shape destiny, which is my focus here.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"453104\">If decisions shape destiny, what determines it is three decisions.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"456224\">What will you focus on?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"457401\">You have to decide what you're going to focus on.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"459876\">Consciously or unconsciously.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"461361\">the minute you decide to focus, you must give it a meaning,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"464296\">and that meaning produces emotion.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"466209\">Is this the end or the beginning?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"468059\">Is God punishing me or rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"471982\">An emotion creates what we're going to do, or the action.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"475000\">So, think about your own life,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"477000\">the decisions that have shaped your destiny.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"479072\">And that sounds really heavy, but in the last five or 10 years,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"482082\">have there been some decisions</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"483653\">that if you'd made a different decision, your life would be completely different?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"487514\">How many can think about it?

me.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1121521\">She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1124943\">and said, \"Honey, I can't tell you what this means.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1127847\">I don't know how to tell you this, but you gave me the greatest gift,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1131220\">because I'm going to die.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1133164\">And she played the recording for us in the room.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1135526\">She was on Larry King later.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1136975\">And he said, \"You're probably wondering</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1138955\">how on Earth this could happen to you twice.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1141071\">All I can say is this must be God's message to you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1143577\">From now on, every day, give your all, love your all.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1146132\">Don't let anything ever stop you.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1148707\">She finishes, and a man stands up, and he says,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1150974\">\"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1152574\">I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1154791\">but frankly, this is retribution.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1158130\">I can't tell you the rest, because I'm out of time.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1160637\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1167319\">Are you sure?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1168519\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1172839\">10 seconds!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1174039\">(Laughter and applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1177371\">10 seconds, I want to be respectful.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1179342\">All I can tell you is,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1180502\">I brought this man on stage</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1182133\">with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1185098\">because I had about 200 New Yorkers there.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1187122\">More than 50 lost their entire companies, friends,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1189581\">marking off their Palm Pilots.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1191127\">One financial trader, woman made of steel, bawling --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1193729\">30 friends crossing off that all died.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1195578\">And I said, \"What are we going to focus on?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1199572\">What does this mean and what are we going to do?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1201934\">And I got the group to focus on:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1204030\">if you didn't lose somebody today,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1205770\">your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1208372\">Then one woman stood up and was so angry, screaming and yelling.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1211504\">I found out she wasn't from New York, she's not an American,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1214444\">doesn't know anybody here.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1215797\">I asked, \"Do you always get angry?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1217583\">She said, \"Yes.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1218784\">Guilty people got guilty, sad people got sad.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1221000\">I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1223699\">Jewish man with family in the occupied territory,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1226108\">someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1229386\">and this man who wanted to be a terrorist,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1231510\">and I made it very clear.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1232814\">This integration is on a film, which I'd be happy to send you,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1235755\">instead of my verbalization,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1237205\">but the two of them not only came together</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1239329\">and changed their beliefs and models of the world,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1241787\">but worked together to bring, for almost four years now,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1244533\">through various mosques and synagogues,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1246436\">the idea of how to create peace.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1248078\">And he wrote a book, called \"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1250765\">So, transformation can happen.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1252312\">My invitation to you is:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1253560\">explore your web,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1255115\">the web in here --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1256689\">the needs, the beliefs, the emotions that are controlling you,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1260301\">for two reasons:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1261502\">so there's more of you to give, and achieve, too,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1263823\">but I mean give,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1265135\">because that's what's going to fill you up.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1267212\">And secondly, so you can appreciate --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1269064\">not just understand, that's intellectual, that's the mind,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1271907\">but appreciate what's driving other people.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1274029\">It's the only way our world's going to change.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1276294\">God bless you, thank you. I hope this was of service.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"1278896\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","    </transcription>\n","    <wordnum>4310</wordnum>\n","    <charnum>23440</charnum>\n","  </head>\n","  <content>Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is: I get a chance to give something back. My challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.\n","(Laughter)\n","I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends -- I do more, obviously, I also coach people -- but I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language? Not just by learning principles, you got in it and you did it so often that it became real.\n","The bottom line of why I'm here, besides being a crazy mofo, is that -- I'm not here to motivate you, you don't need that, obviously. Often that's what people think I do, and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens, though, is people say to me, \"I don't need any motivation.\" But that's not what I do. I'm the \"why\" guy. I want to know why you do what you do.\n","What is your motive for action? What is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago. Are you running the same pattern? Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated, is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds, right? We all know how to think. With our minds we can rationalize anything. We can make anything happen.\n","I agree with what was described a few days ago, that people work in their self-interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your self-interest all the time, because when emotion comes into it, the wiring changes in the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is, especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head. But I really want to know what's driving you.\n","What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons. One: so that you can contribute more. And two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more, but appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us, because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of \"everybody now understands everybody, and everybody appreciates everybody.\"\n","I've had an obsession basically for 30 years, \"What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives? What in their performance?\" I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for 30 years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television, and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide, I've got to do something. In 29 years, I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day, but I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding of these human needs.\n","When I get those calls about performance, that's one thing. How do you make a change? I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute, to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is, I look at life and say there's two master lessons. One is: there's the science of achievement, which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly. \"How do you take the invisible and make it visible,\" How do you make your dreams happen? Your business, your contribution to society, money -- whatever, your body, your family.\n","The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy, right? We know the rules, you write the code and you get the results. Once you know the game, you just up the ante, don't you? But when it comes to fulfillment -- that's an art. The reason is, it's about appreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself.\n","I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to? Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a 100-dollar computer, but the best computer. You gave them love, joy, were there to comfort them. Those people very often -- you know some of them -- end up the rest of their life with all this love, education, money and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been through ultimate pain, psychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused -- and not always, but often, they become some of the people that contribute the most to society.\n","The question we've got to ask ourselves really is, what is it? What is it that shapes us? We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that, but the culture's a therapy culture, the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that, but most of society thinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves -- because you can know something intellectually and then not use it, not apply it.\n","We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people, have you failed to achieve something significant in your life?\n","Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n","TR: Thanks for the interaction on a high level there. But if you ask people, why didn't you achieve something? Somebody who's working for you, or a partner, or even yourself. When you fail to achieve, what's the reason people say? What do they tell you? Didn't have the knowledge, didn't have the money, didn't have the time, didn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager.\n","Al Gore: Supreme Court. TR: The Supreme Court.\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause) (Cheering)\n","(Applause continues)\n","TR: And --\n","(Applause)\n","What do all those, including the Supreme Court, have in common?\n","(Laughter)\n","They are a claim to you missing resources, and they may be accurate. You may not have the money, or the Supreme Court, but that is not the defining factor.\n","(Applause) (Laughter)\n","And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources; it's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase, is if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won.\n","Audience: Yeah!\n","(Applause) (Cheering)\n","How easy for me to tell him what he should do.\n","(Laughter)\n","Idiot, Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time, there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across to some people on that day -- because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't, and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about?\n","Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n","TR: So, emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative, playful, fun enough, can you get through to anybody, yes or no?\n","If you don't have the money, but you're creative and determined, you find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story that people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have the resources, but ultimately, if you take a look here, they say, what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that? He's broken my pattern, that son-of-a-bitch.\n","(Laughter)\n","But I appreciated the energy, I'll tell you that.\n","(Laughter)\n","What determines your resources? We've said decisions shape destiny, which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny, what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on? You have to decide what you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus, you must give it a meaning, and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning? Is God punishing me or rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice? An emotion creates what we're going to do, or the action.\n","So, think about your own life, the decisions that have shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy, but in the last five or 10 years, have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision, your life would be completely different? How many can think about it? Better or worse. Say, \"Aye.\"\n","Audience: Aye.\n","So the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work, and you met the love of your life there, a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here -- I mean, I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture? How would the world or their lives be different, their impact? The history of our world is these decisions. When a woman stands up and says, \"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.\" She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong, \"You've got testicular cancer.\" That's pretty tough for any male, especially if you ride a bike.\n","(Laughter)\n","You've got it in your brain; you've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision of what to focus on? Different than most people. What did it mean? It wasn't the end; it was the beginning. He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer, because he got emotional fitness, psychological strength. That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around.\n","In my lab, I've had three million people from 80 countries over the last 29 years. And after a while, patterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way, right? Others say, \"Oh, that sounds ridiculous.\" It's simple. So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you? Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One: state. We all have had times, you did something, and after, you thought to yourself, \"I can't believe I said or did that, that was so stupid.\" Who's been there? Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n","Or after you did something, you go, \"That was me!\"\n","(Laughter)\n","It wasn't your ability; it was your state. Your model of the world is what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody, we need to know what already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First, what's your target? What are you after? It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought, is this all there is?\n","Say, \"Aye.\" Audience: Aye.\n","It's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs. Second, once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth -- you don't form it -- then you find out what's your map, what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world, some people, to build, create something, love someone. There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs.\n","Let me tell you what they are. First one: certainty. These are not goals or desires, these are universal. Everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now, how do you get it? Control everybody? Develop a skill? Give up? Smoke a cigarette? And if you got totally certain, ironically, even though we need that -- you're not certain about your health, or your children, or money. If you're not sure the ceiling will hold up, you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently, if we get total certainty, we get what? What do you feel if you're certain? You know what will happen, when and how it will happen, what would you feel? Bored out of your minds. So, God, in Her infinite wisdom, gave us a second human need, which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here love surprises? Say, \"Aye.\"\n","Audience: Aye.\n","TR: Bullshit. You like the surprises you want. The ones you don't want, you call problems, but you need them. So, variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen? Who's done this? Get a fucking life.\n","(Laughter)\n","Why are you doing it? You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before, but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten, and there's variety.\n","Third human need, critical: significance. We all need to feel important, special, unique. You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this, if you have no background, no culture, no belief and resources or resourcefulness, is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant. Zero to 10. How high? 10. How certain am I that you're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty? Who knows what's going to happen next? Kind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant, isn't it? So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species. You can get significance a million ways, but to be significant, you've got to be unique and different.\n","Here's what we really need: connection and love, fourth need. We all want it; most settle for connection, love's too scary. Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship? If you don't raise your hand, you've had other shit, too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit? Here's what's true: we need it. We can do it through intimacy, friendship, prayer, through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you, don't get a cat, get a dog, because if you leave for two minutes, it's like you've been gone six months, when you come back 5 minutes later.\n","These first four needs, every human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself, you need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs the needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way, smoke, drink, do whatever, meet the first four. But number five, you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow, you're what? If a relationship or business is not growing, if you're not growing, doesn't matter how much money or friends you have, how many love you, you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value.\n","Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know, corny as that sounds, the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me, it's about we. This culture knows that, this room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his $100 computer, the most exciting thing is: here's a genius, but he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him, and it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people.\n","My life was touched because when I was 11 years old, Thanksgiving, no money, no food, we were not going to starve, but my father was totally messed up, my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up, and somebody came to the door and delivered food. My father made three decisions, I know what they were, briefly. His focus was \"This is charity. What does it mean? I'm worthless. What do I have to do? Leave my family,\" which he did. It was one of the most painful experiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path. I set focus on \"There's food.\" What a concept!\n","(Laughter)\n","But this is what changed my life, shaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift, I don't even know who it is. My father always said, \"No one gives a shit.\" And now somebody I don't know, they're not asking for anything, just giving us food, looking out for us. It made me believe this: that strangers care. And that made me decide, if strangers care about me and my family, I care about them. I'm going to do something to make a difference. So when I was 17, I went out on Thanksgiving, it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life. Next year, I did four, then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing, I wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight, I thought I could use some help.\n","So I went out, got my friends involved, then I grew companies, got 11, and I built the foundation. 18 years later, I'm proud to tell you last year we fed 2 million people in 35 countries through our foundation. All during the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, in different countries around the world.\n","(Applause)\n","Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag, but because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it, not talk about it.\n","So, finally -- I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you -- Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak, is that what you value most, or uncertainty? This man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love? We all need all six, but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction, you have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system tells you how to get there, and some people's map is, \"I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people,\" and they're a fireman, and somebody else says, \"I'm going to kill people to do it.\" They're trying to meet the same needs of significance. They want to honor God or honor their family. But they have a different map.\n","And there are seven different beliefs; I can't go through them, because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea of a long time is 100 years. Somebody else's is three seconds, which is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you. If you've got a target and a map -- I can't use Google because I love Macs, and they haven't made it good for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest -- how many have made this fatal mistake of using it? You use this thing and you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go.\n","(Laughter)\n","The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions that we have words for in the English language, which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions -- If I have 20,000 people or 1,000 and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week, and I give them as long as they need, and on one side they write empowering emotions, the other's disempowering, guess how many emotions they experience? Less than 12. And half of those make them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy, happy, excited, oh shit, frustrated, frustrated, overwhelmed, depressed. How many of you know somebody who, no matter what happens, finds a way to get pissed off?\n","(Laughter)\n","Or no matter what happens, they find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this?\n","When 9/11 happened, I'll finish with this, I was in Hawaii. I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries, we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting, for a week. The night before was called Emotional Mastery. I got up, had no plan for this, and I said -- we had fireworks, I do crazy shit, fun stuff, and at the end, I stopped. I had this plan, but I never know what I'm going to say. And all of a sudden, I said, \"When do people really start to live? When they face death.\" And I went through this whole thing about, if you weren't going to get off this island, if nine days from now, you were going to die, who would you call, what would you say, what would you do? That night is when 9/11 happened.\n","One woman had come to the seminar, and when she came there, her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her, and she said no.\n","He said, \"If you go to that Hawaii thing, it's over with us.\" She said, \"It's over.\" When I finished that night, she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked, saying, \"I love you, I want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me.\" She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back, and said, \"Honey, I can't tell you what this means. I don't know how to tell you this, but you gave me the greatest gift, because I'm going to die.\" And she played the recording for us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said, \"You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice. All I can say is this must be God's message to you. From now on, every day, give your all, love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you.\" She finishes, and a man stands up, and he says, \"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry, but frankly, this is retribution.\" I can't tell you the rest, because I'm out of time.\n","(Laughter)\n","Are you sure?\n","(Laughter)\n","10 seconds!\n","(Laughter and applause)\n","10 seconds, I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is, I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center, because I had about 200 New Yorkers there. More than 50 lost their entire companies, friends, marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader, woman made of steel, bawling -- 30 friends crossing off that all died. And I said, \"What are we going to focus on? What does this mean and what are we going to do?\"\n","And I got the group to focus on: if you didn't lose somebody today, your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up and was so angry, screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York, she's not an American, doesn't know anybody here. I asked, \"Do you always get angry?\" She said, \"Yes.\" Guilty people got guilty, sad people got sad. I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family in the occupied territory, someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day, and this man who wanted to be a terrorist, and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film, which I'd be happy to send you, instead of my verbalization, but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world, but worked together to bring, for almost four years now, through various mosques and synagogues, the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book, called \"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.\" So, transformation can happen.\n","My invitation to you is: explore your web, the web in here -- the needs, the beliefs, the emotions that are controlling you, for two reasons: so there's more of you to give, and achieve, too, but I mean give, because that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly, so you can appreciate -- not just understand, that's intellectual, that's the mind, but appreciate what's driving other people. It's the only way our world's going to change.\n","God bless you, thank you. I hope this was of service.\n","(Applause)</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2082\">\n","  <head>\n","    <url>http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity</url>\n","    <pagesize>95828</pagesize>\n","    <dtime>Thu Jan 28 17:37:37 CET 2016</dtime>\n","    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>\n","    <content-type>text/html; charset=utf-8</content-type>\n","    <keywords>talks, children, creativity, culture, dance, education, parenting</keywords>\n","    <speaker>Ken Robinson</speaker>\n","    <talkid>66</talkid>\n","    <videourl>http://download.ted.com/talks/SirKenRobinson_2006.mp4</videourl>\n","    <videopath>talks/SirKenRobinson_2006.mp4</videopath>\n","    <date>2006/02/25</date>\n","    <title>Ken Robinson: Do schools kill creativity?</title>\n","    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Sir Ken Robinson makes an entertaining and profoundly moving case for creating an education system that nurtures (rather than undermines) creativity.</description>\n","    <transcription>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"0\">Good morning. How are you?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"4702\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"5936\">It's been great, hasn't it?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"8273\">I've been blown away by the whole thing.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"10753\">In fact, I'm leaving.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"12269\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"18015\">There have been three themes running through the conference</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"21246\">which are relevant to what I want to talk about.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"23777\">One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"28491\">in all of the presentations that we've had</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"30928\">and in all of the people here.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"32753\">Just the variety of it and the range of it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"36158\">The second is that it's put us in a place</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"38325\">where we have no idea what's going to happen,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"40846\">in terms of the future.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"42261\">No idea how this may play out.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"45000\">I have an interest in education.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"46916\">Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"51072\">Don't you?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"52234\">I find this very interesting.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"53739\">If you're at a dinner party,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"55596\">and you say you work in education --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"57882\">Actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"60870\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"64690\">If you work in education, you're not asked.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"67142\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"70257\">And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"74000\">But if you are, and you say to somebody,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"76499\">you know, they say, \"What do you do?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"78300\">and you say you work in education,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"80000\">you can see the blood run from their face.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"82100\">They're like, \"Oh my God,\" you know, \"Why me?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"84404\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"86065\">\"My one night out all week.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"87712\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"90346\">But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"93611\">Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"97194\">Like religion, and money and other things.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"100559\">So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"104935\">We have a huge vested interest in it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"106851\">partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"110195\">that we can't grasp.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"111873\">If you think of it, children starting school this year</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"115396\">will be retiring in 2065.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"120209\">Nobody has a clue,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"121867\">despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"125450\">what the world will look like in five years' time.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"128000\">And yet we're meant to be educating them for it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"130318\">So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"132892\">And the third part of this</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"134283\">is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"136344\">on the really extraordinary capacities that children have --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"141673\">their capacities for innovation.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"144031\">I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"146566\">Just seeing what she could do.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"148200\">And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"153000\">exceptional in the whole of childhood.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"156980\">What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"159800\">who found a talent.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"161091\">And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"163800\">And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"165800\">So I want to talk about education</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"168000\">and I want to talk about creativity.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"169896\">My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"175939\">and we should treat it with the same status.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"178827\">(Applause) Thank you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"180822\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"185485\">That was it, by the way.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"186768\">Thank you very much.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"187795\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"189934\">So, 15 minutes left.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"191635\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"194595\">Well, I was born... no.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"196511\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"199567\">I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"202336\">of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"205075\">She was six, and she was at the back, drawing,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"207234\">and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"210058\">and in this drawing lesson, she did.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"211868\">The teacher was fascinated.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"213232\">She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"216018\">And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"219642\">And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"222984\">And the girl said, \"They will, in a minute.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"225096\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"236662\">When my son was four in England --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"239413\">Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"241628\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"243404\">If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"246815\">He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"249477\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"250720\">No, it was big, it was a big story.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"252571\">Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"254900\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"256185\">\"Nativity II.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"257519\">But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"261678\">We considered this to be one of the lead parts.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"264239\">We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"266740\">\"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"269000\">He didn't have to speak,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"270631\">but you know the bit where the three kings come in?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"273093\">They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"275848\">This really happened.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"276986\">We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"280100\">because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"282900\">\"You OK with that?\" And he said, \"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"285800\">They just switched.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"286900\">The three boys came in,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"288100\">four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"290311\">and they put these boxes down,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"291826\">and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"293899\">And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"296061\">And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"298089\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"310711\">What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"313825\">If they don't know, they'll have a go.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"316457\">Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"320893\">I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"324886\">What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"328000\">you'll never come up with anything original --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"330391\">if you're not prepared to be wrong.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"332877\">And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"337406\">They have become frightened of being wrong.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"339950\">And we run our companies like this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"341664\">We stigmatize mistakes.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"343340\">And we're now running national education systems</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"345666\">where mistakes are the worst thing you can make.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"348700\">And the result is that we are educating people</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"351932\">out of their creative capacities.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"354247\">Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"358749\">The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"361995\">I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"365100\">we grow out of it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"366980\">Or rather, we get educated out if it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"369247\">So why is this?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"370826\">I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"374931\">In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"377872\">So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"380560\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"382000\">Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"384400\">just outside Stratford,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"385675\">which is where Shakespeare's father was born.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"388082\">Are you struck by a new thought? I was.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"390481\">You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"393100\">Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"397000\">Shakespeare being seven?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"398591\">I never thought of it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"399864\">I mean, he was seven at some point.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"401572\">He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"403906\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"410717\">How annoying would that be?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"412070\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"419729\">\"Must try harder.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"420788\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"424712\">Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"428200\">And put the pencil down.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"430652\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"431750\">\"And stop speaking like that.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"433329\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"437244\">\"It's confusing everybody.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"438592\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"443739\">Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"449101\">and I just want to say a word about the transition.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"451566\">My son didn't want to come.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"453000\">I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"456000\">He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"458068\">He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"461048\">This was the love of his life, Sarah.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"464761\">He'd known her for a month.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"466160\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"467534\">Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"469814\">because it's a long time when you're 16.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"472777\">He was really upset on the plane,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"474462\">he said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"476947\">And we were rather pleased about that, frankly --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"479349\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"487395\">Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"490300\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"496059\">But something strikes you when you move to America</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"498425\">and travel around the world:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"499815\">Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"503537\">Every one.

How are you?\n","(Laughter)\n","It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving.\n","(Laughter)\n","There have been three themes running through the conference which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen, in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out.\n","I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- Actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly.\n","(Laughter)\n","If you work in education, you're not asked.\n","(Laughter)\n","And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God,\" you know, \"Why me?\"\n","(Laughter)\n","\"My one night out all week.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion, and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary.\n","And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents. And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.\n","So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.\n","(Applause) Thank you.\n","(Applause)\n","That was it, by the way. Thank you very much.\n","(Laughter)\n","So, 15 minutes left.\n","(Laughter)\n","Well, I was born... no.\n","(Laughter)\n","I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said, \"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody knows what God looks like.\" And the girl said, \"They will, in a minute.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","When my son was four in England -- Actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest.\n","(Laughter)\n","If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story?\n","(Laughter)\n","No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it.\n","(Laughter)\n","\"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, \"You OK with that?\" And he said, \"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads, and they put these boxes down, and the first boy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said, \"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.\n","Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out if it. So why is this?\n","I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.\n","(Laughter)\n","Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he?\n","(Laughter)\n","How annoying would that be?\n","(Laughter)\n","\"Must try harder.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now! And put the pencil down.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","\"And stop speaking like that.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","\"It's confusing everybody.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. My son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month.\n","(Laughter)\n","Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane, he said, \"I'll never find another girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased about that, frankly --\n","(Laughter)\n","Because she was the main reason we were leaving the country.\n","(Laughter)\n","But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities, and at the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting?\n","(Laughter)\n","Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side.\n","If you were to visit education, as an alien, and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there.\n","(Laughter)\n","And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life, another form of life. But they're rather curious, and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious about professors in my experience -- not all of them, but typically, they live in their heads. They live up there, and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads.\n","(Laughter)\n","Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings.\n","(Laughter)\n","If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics, and pop into the discotheque on the final night.\n","(Laughter)\n","And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.\n","(Laughter)\n","Waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it.\n","(Laughter)\n","Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.\n","Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist. Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution.\n","And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly-talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way.\n","In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people, and it's the combination of all the things we've talked about -- technology and its transformation effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.\n","Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.\n","We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things.\n","By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often, thankfully.\n","(Laughter)\n","No, she's good at some things, but if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling, she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","\"Give me a break.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen? Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\"\n","(Laughter)\n","And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian has a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition.\n","(Laughter)\n","People weren't aware they could have that.\n","(Laughter)\n","Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about the problems Gillian was having at school. Because she was disturbing people; her homework was always late; and so on, little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian, and said, \"I've listened to all these things your mother's told me, I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back; we won't be very long,\" and they went and left her.\n","But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out, he said to her mother, \"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick; she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\"\n","I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School; she became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multi-millionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down.\n","(Applause)\n","What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth: for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children.\n","There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right.\n","What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.\n","Thank you very much.\n","(Applause)</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2083\">\n","  <head>\n","

id=\"801174\">that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"803935\">We need Republicans as well.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"805464\">This used to be a bipartisan issue,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"807497\">and I know that in this group it really is.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"809978\">Become politically active.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"811554\">Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"814753\">Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"820326\">global warming pollution -- and trading it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"822365\">Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"827000\">it's not a closed system.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"828692\">Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S.

<seekvideo id=\"852277\">that can be avoided.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"853610\">The market will work to solve this problem --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"858949\">if we can accomplish this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"862434\">Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"865843\">We have to change the minds of the American people.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"868375\">Because presently, the politicians do not have permission</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"871158\">to do what needs to be done.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"873355\">And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"878833\">mediating between wealth and power the way it once did.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"881811\">It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"887395\">We have to buy a lot of those ads.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"890221\">Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"894555\">I like \"climate crisis\" instead of \"climate collapse,\"</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"897448\">but again, those of you who are good at branding,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"899799\">I need your help on this.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"901768\">Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"905892\">is whether the combination of an opposable thumb</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"909000\">and a neocortex is a viable combination.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"911947\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"913825\">That's really true.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"918160\">I said the other night, and I'll repeat now:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"921584\">this is not a political issue.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"923773\">Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo

just this, but connected to the ideas that are here,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"939797\">to bring more coherence to them.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"942495\">We are one.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"944065\">Thank you very much, I appreciate it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"946424\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","    </transcription>\n","

And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that.\n","(Laughter)\n","Put yourselves in my position.\n","(Laughter)\n","I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.\n","(Laughter)\n","Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.\n","(Laughter)\n","It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.\n","Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House --\n","(Laughter)\n","we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves.\n","(Laughter)\n","I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but --\n","(Laughter)\n","I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there.\n","(Laughter)\n","You've heard of phantom limb pain?\n","(Laughter)\n","This was a rented Ford Taurus.\n","(Laughter)\n","It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.\n","(Laughter)\n","She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said \"Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.\" And the man said, \"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?\"\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.\n","(Laughter)\n","The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, \"Call Washington! Call Washington!\" And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.\n","(Laughter)\n","But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked.\n","(Laughter)\n","And the story began, \"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,\" quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'\" --\n","(Laughter)\n","\"'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, \"One more burger with fries!\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, \"Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!\"\n","(Laughter)\n","We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.\n","(Laughter)\n","I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time.\n","(Applause)\n","Chris Anderson: It's a deal!\n","(Applause)\n","Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees.\n","Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.\n","Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do?\n","Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important.\n","Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.\n","There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.\n","Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that.\n","Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.\n","(Applause)\n","Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.\n","And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. I like \"climate crisis\" instead of \"climate collapse,\" but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.\n","(Laughter)\n","That's really true.\n","I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one.\n","Thank you very much, I appreciate it.\n","(Applause)</content>\n","</file>\n","<file id=\"2084\">\n","  <head>\n","    <url>http://www.ted.com/talks/david_pogue_says_simplicity_sells</url>\n","    <pagesize>79056</pagesize>\n","    <dtime>Thu Jan 28 17:37:56 CET 2016</dtime>\n","    <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>\n","    <content-type>text/html; charset=utf-8</content-type>\n","    <keywords>talks, TED Conference, computers, entertainment, interface design, media, music, performance, simplicity, software, technology</keywords>\n","    <speaker>David Pogue</speaker>\n","    <talkid>7</talkid>\n","    <videourl>http://download.ted.com/talks/DavidPogue_2006.mp4</videourl>\n","    <videopath>talks/DavidPogue_2006.mp4</videopath>\n","    <date>2006/02/24</date>\n","    <title>David Pogue: Simplicity sells</title>\n","    <description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: New York Times columnist David Pogue takes aim at technology’s worst interface-design offenders, and provides encouraging examples of products that get it right.

I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me.\n","(Laughter)\n","And you listen to the sounds of silence.\n","(Music)\n","(Applause)\n","Thank you.\n","Good evening and welcome to: \"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is -- first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.\n","If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things -- Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, \"\"Me too, and here's my tale of woe.\" I call it \"software rage.\" And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.\n","(Laughter)\n","Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire operating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!\n","(Laughter)\n","So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time.\n","I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that -- you know how they say, \"Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?\" Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.\n","(Laughter)\n","Which they do.\n","(Laughter)\n","And I have a copy.\n","(Laughter)\n","It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it!\n","So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said,\n","\"Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?\"\n","She says, \"All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","And the technician's like, \"Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?\"\n","She goes, \"Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Well, if you like that one -- how much time have we got? Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true -- his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed \"11.\" And the technician said, \"What? Why are you typing 11?\" He said, \"The message says, 'Error Type 11.'\"\n","(Laughter)\n","So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now?\n","In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, \"We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99.\" I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.\n","I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.\n","(Laughter)\n","But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, \"Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database.\" And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, \"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday.\" So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.\n","(Laughter)\n","This is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.\n","(Laughter)\n","And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you -- it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features. So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view.\n","Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.\n","(Applause)\n","Thank you -- yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. There are these \"wizards\" everywhere. And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.\n","[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard]\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","\"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.\" Ok, I'll bite. Let's click \"Next\" to continue.\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.\n","(Laughter)\n","So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.\n","If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan. So why is \"United States\" in the \"U\"s?\n","(Laughter)\n","You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent to put \"United States\" first, but it would be intelligent.\n","This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called \"Start?\"\n","(Laughter)\n","Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.\n","(Laughter)\n","And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not \"Print.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees. He says, \"Nice talk.\" And I said, \"Thank you. What do you do here?\" He said, \"I'm a tap counter.\" I'm like, \"You're a what?\" He goes, \"Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.\" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.\n","(Laughter)\n","This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word -- it could happen.\n","(Laughter)\n","You go up to the \"File\" menu and you choose \"New.\" Now, what happens when you choose \"New?\" Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links -- by the way, not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company not counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do.\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","The Bill Gates song!\n","(Piano music)\n","I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.\n","(Laughter)\n","I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&amp;D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code.\n","(Applause)\n","But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code?\n","(Laughter)\n","So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny -- when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo -- he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen -- I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie \"Evita\" --\n","(Laughter)\n","with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.\n","(Music)\n","It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.\n","(Laughter)\n","When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz.\n","(Laughter)\n","You try rhyming with garage!\n","(Laughter)\n","Don't cry for me, Cupertino.\n","(Laughter)\n","The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar.\n","(Laughter)\n","Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather.\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","Thank you.\n","So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share -- people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.\n","(Laughter)\n","But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won -- this is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing -- it's catching on.\n","I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?\n","Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along -- and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.\n","(Applause)\n","In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period. I also use this feature called voice macros; period. Correct \"dissuade.\" Not \"just.\" Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, \"Thanks for that.\"\n","[Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...]\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- I say, \"Piss off.\"\n","(Laughter)\n","[I admire your frankness ...]\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.\n","(Laughter)\n","So the point is -- this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight? No new features. It's never happened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, \"We'll make this software work right.\" Right? Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, \"This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate.\" And so that's what they did.\n","This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.\n","CA: Bravo.

id=\"51832\">a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"57000\">the world's largest food-distribution center,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"59359\">as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"63565\">to the area each week.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"65118\">The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"69110\">So when I was contacted by the Parks Department</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"71427\">about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"75609\">I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"78547\">I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"82238\">because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"85555\">Then, while jogging with my dog one morning,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"87839\">she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"91606\">There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"95407\">but she kept dragging me,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"96645\">and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"99541\">I knew that this forgotten little street-end,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"101666\">abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"104694\">And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"107314\">of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"110322\">And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"114325\">We garnered much support along the way,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"116484\">and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"119668\">that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"122091\">We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"125481\">into a $3 million park.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"127745\">And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"132697\">(Audience whistles)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"133721\">Thank you very much.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"135013\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"139579\">That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"143000\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"145488\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"148829\">But those of us living in environmental justice communities</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"151631\">are the canary in the coal mine.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"153210\">We feel the problems right now, and have for some time.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"157290\">Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"161000\">goes something like this:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"162224\">no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"165239\">and less environmental benefits than any other.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"167929\">Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"172000\">as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"175061\">and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"178817\">As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"182076\">to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"185697\">I am five times more likely to live within walking distance</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"188504\">of a power plant or chemical facility,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"190437\">which I do.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"192149\">These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"194804\">that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"197820\">Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"201745\">Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"204680\">and diabetes comes with it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"206117\">One out of four South Bronx children has asthma.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"208649\">Our asthma hospitalization rate</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"210488\">is seven times higher than the national average.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"212795\">These impacts are coming everyone's way.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"214770\">And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"217000\">health problems associated with pollution and more odiously,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"220000\">the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"223013\">who possess untold amounts of untapped potential.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"225792\">Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line;</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"228896\">25 percent of us are unemployed.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"230675\">Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"234722\">This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"238645\">Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"242512\">Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"246321\">that won't compromise the lives</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"247845\">of low-income communities of color in the short term,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"250369\">and won't destroy us all in the long term.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"252499\">None of us want that, and we all have that in common.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"255009\">So what else do we have in common?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"256672\">Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"259474\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"260685\">Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"263496\">traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"266832\">financially stable, never been imprisoned.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"270688\">OK. Good.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"271872\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"273235\">But, besides being a black woman,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"274866\">I am different from most of you in some other ways.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"277552\">I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"280967\">My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"282954\">only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"288992\">Jesus.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"290271\">I grew up with a crack house across the street.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"294796\">Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"298784\">These things make me different from you.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"300975\">But the things we have in common</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"302862\">set me apart from most of the people in my community,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"305625\">and I am in between these two worlds</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"307475\">with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"311315\">So how did things get so different for us?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"313347\">In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"316702\">bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"319593\">and a few years later, he married my mom.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"321632\">At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"325137\">My dad was not alone.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"326687\">And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"330148\">white flight became common in the South Bronx</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"332701\">and in many cities around the country.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"335018\">Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"338675\">including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"342688\">Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"346180\">and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"350375\">dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"352839\">Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"355705\">but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"359655\">A national highway construction boom was added to our problems.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"362865\">In New York State,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"364040\">Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"367847\">One of its primary goals was to make it easier</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"370067\">for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"375116\">The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"378215\">Residents were often given less than a month's notice</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"380789\">before their buildings were razed.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"382443\">600,000 people were displaced.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"384791\">The common perception was</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"386125\">that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"390000\">And if you are told from your earliest days</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"392954\">that nothing good is going to come from your community,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"395595\">that it's bad and ugly,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"396770\">how could it not reflect on you?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"399335\">So now, my family's property was worthless,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"401877\">save for that it was our home, and all we had.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"404543\">And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"408293\">along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"413459\">Now, why is this story important?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"415172\">Because from a planning perspective,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"417006\">economic degradation begets environmental degradation,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"420747\">which begets social degradation.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"423287\">The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"426374\">for all the environmental injustices that were to come.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"429000\">Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"433000\">to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"436067\">Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"439869\">What costs are associated with these decisions?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"442489\">And who pays? Who profits?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"444749\">Does anything justify what the local community goes through?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"448392\">This was \"planning\" -- in quotes --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"450710\">that did not have our best interests in mind.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"453002\">Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"456441\">That small park I told you about earlier</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"458409\">was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"461711\">I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"465087\">to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"467219\">with dedicated on-street bike paths.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"468973\">Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"472455\">the placement of the waste and other facilities,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"474724\">which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"478220\">They provide opportunities to be more physically active,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"480958\">as well as local economic development.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"483415\">Think bike shops, juice stands.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"485011\">We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"487906\">This is Lafayette Avenue --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"489804\">and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"492985\">And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"496030\">with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"498403\">Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"502401\">As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"506689\">We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"510524\">which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"513855\">so that folks from our community have the skills to compete</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"516680\">for these well-paying jobs.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"518043\">Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"521404\">and with people that have both a financial and personal stake</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"524287\">in their environment.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"525468\">The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"528135\">of the Robert Moses era,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"529358\">built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"532758\">Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"535551\">The community created an alternative transportation plan</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"538247\">that allows for the removal of the highway.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"540897\">We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"544044\">to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"546656\">for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"549722\">We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"554573\">on top of our offices.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"555985\">Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"559474\">and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"561601\">Green roofs are soil and living plants.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"563657\">Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"566928\">that absorb heat, contribute to urban \"heat island\" effect</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"569723\">and degrade under the sun,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"571072\">which we in turn breathe.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"572318\">Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"575000\">so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"578683\">which, incidentally, are often located</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"580527\">in environmental justice communities like mine.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"582772\">And they provide habitats for our little friends!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"586096\">[Butterfly]</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"587277\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"588524\">So cool!</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"589731\">Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"592261\">for our own green roof installation business,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"594409\">bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"597935\">[Green is the new black ...]</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"599335\">(Laughter) (Applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"603502\">I like that, too.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"605177\">Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"608897\">but since I have all of your attention:</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"610801\">We need investors. End of pitch.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"612412\">It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"614824\">Anyway --</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"616004\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"617488\">(Applause)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"622431\">OK. Katrina.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"625884\">Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"628932\">had a lot in common.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"630145\">Both were largely populated by poor people of color,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"632923\">both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"636242\">Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"639600\">in close proximity of one another.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"641510\">In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"644582\">We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"648084\">by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"651455\">and lax governmental accountability.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"653652\">Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"658104\">But we have emerged with valuable lessons</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"660264\">about how to dig ourselves out.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"662561\">We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"666387\">or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"669717\">of presidents come and gone.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"671351\">Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"674194\">like the South Bronx did?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"675480\">Or will we take proactive steps</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"676988\">and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"679949\">that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"682819\">Now listen, I do not expect individuals,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"685486\">corporations or government to make the world a better place</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"688295\">because it is right or moral.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"690596\">This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"694900\">Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"697000\">But I'll tell you later, if you want to know.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"699120\">(Laughter)</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"700209\">But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it,</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo id=\"704523\">that motivates people in the end.</seekvideo>\n","      <seekvideo

very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger.\n","The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city.\n","So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.\n","And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park.\n","And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved.\n","(Audience whistles)\n","Thank you very much.\n","(Applause)\n","That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time.\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other.\n","Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy.\n","Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that, and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common?\n","Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking.\n","(Laughter)\n","Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good.\n","(Laughter)\n","But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other.\n","So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding.\n","Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had. And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough.\n","Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify what the local community goes through? This was \"planning\" -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind.\n","Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that.\n","As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.\n","We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban \"heat island\" effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends!\n","[Butterfly]\n","(Laughter)\n","So cool!\n","Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.\n","[Green is the new black ...]\n","(Laughter) (Applause)\n","I like that, too.\n","Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway --\n","(Laughter)\n","(Applause)\n","OK. Katrina.\n","Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common. We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?\n","Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later, if you want to know.\n","(Laughter)\n","But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the \"triple bottom line\" that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up.\n","At present, that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues.\n","Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have --\n","(Laughter)\n","You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to.\n","(Laughter)\n","So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization.\n","Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that.\n","You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere.

are two reasons companies fail: they only do more of the same, or they only do what's new.\",\n"," 'To me the real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation.',\n"," 'Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing.',\n"," 'Consider Facit.',\n"," \"I'm actually old enough to remember them.\",\n"," 'Facit was a fantastic company.',\n"," 'They were born deep in the Swedish forest, and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world.',\n"," 'Everybody used them.',\n"," 'And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along?',\n"," 'They continued doing exactly the same.',\n"," 'In six months, they went from maximum revenue ... and they were gone.',\n"," 'Gone.',\n"," 'To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators.',\n"," 'Facit did too much exploitation.',\n"," 'But exploration can go wild, too.',\n"," 'A few years back, I worked closely alongside a European biotech company.',\n"," \"Let's call them OncoSearch.\",\n"," 'The company was brilliant.',\n"," 'They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer.',\n"," 'Every day was about creating something new.',\n"," 'They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, \"When we only get it right,\" or even, \"We want it perfect.\"',\n"," 'The sad thing is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they became obsolete.',\n"," 'OncoSearch did too much exploration.',\n"," 'I first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago, when I worked as a visiting scholar at Stanford University.',\n"," 'The founder of the idea is Jim March.',\n"," 'And to me the power of the idea is its practicality.',\n"," 'Exploration.',\n"," \"Exploration is about coming up with what's new.\",\n"," \"It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about new innovations.\",\n"," \"It's about changing our frontiers.\",\n"," 'Our heroes are people who have done exploration: Madame Curie, Picasso, Neil Armstrong, Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.',\n"," 'I come from Norway; all our heroes are explorers, and they deserve to be.',\n"," 'We all know that exploration is risky.',\n"," \"We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know that the risks are high.\",\n"," 'Exploitation is the opposite.',\n"," 'Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better.',\n"," 'Exploitation is about making our trains run on time.',\n"," \"It's about making good products faster and cheaper.\",\n"," 'Exploitation is not risky -- in the short term.',\n"," \"But if we only exploit, it's very risky in the long term.\",\n"," 'And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again, until they become obsolete or even pathetic.',\n"," \"That's the risk of exploitation.\",\n"," 'So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore.',\n"," 'If we take a short-term perspective, we exploit.',\n"," 'Small children, they explore all day.',\n"," \"All day it's about exploration.\",\n"," 'As we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on.',\n"," 'The same goes for companies.',\n"," 'Companies become, by nature, less innovative as they become more competent.',\n"," 'And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs.',\n"," 'And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways.',\n"," 'For example, \"How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?\"',\n"," 'Or, \"How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?\"',\n"," 'So, doing one well is difficult.',\n"," 'Doing both well as the same time is art -- pushing both exploration and exploitation.',\n"," \"So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time, in parallel.\",\n"," 'But when they do, the payoffs are huge.',\n"," 'So we have lots of great examples.',\n"," 'We have Nestlé creating Nespresso, we have Lego going into animated films, Toyota creating the hybrids, Unilever pushing into sustainability -- there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge.',\n"," 'Why is balancing so difficult?',\n"," \"I think it's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are.\",\n"," \"So I'll talk about two, but there are many.\",\n"," \"So let's talk about the perpetual search trap.\",\n"," \"We discover something, but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work.\",\n"," 'So instead of staying with it, we create something new.',\n"," \"But the same goes for that, then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated.\",\n"," 'OncoSearch was a good example.',\n"," 'A famous example is, of course, Xerox.',\n"," \"But we don't only see this in companies.\",\n"," 'We see this in the public sector as well.',\n"," 'We all know that any kind of effective reform of education, research, health care, even defense, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.',\n"," 'But still, we change much more often.',\n"," \"We really don't give them the chance.\",\n"," 'Another trap is the success trap.',\n"," 'Facit fell into the success trap.',\n"," \"They literally held the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it.\",\n"," \"They were simply so good at making what they loved doing, that they wouldn't change.\",\n"," 'We are like that, too.',\n"," \"When we know something well, it's difficult to change.\",\n"," 'Bill Gates has said: \"Success is a lousy teacher.',\n"," 'It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail.\"',\n"," \"That's the challenge with success.\",\n"," 'So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us.',\n"," 'And they apply to our companies.',\n"," 'The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis.',\n"," \"And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future.\",\n"," 'Netflix -- they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution, but they always -- and I think they will always -- keep pushing for the next battle.',\n"," 'I see other companies that say, \"I\\'ll win the next innovation cycle, whatever it takes.\"',\n"," 'Second one: think in multiple time scales.',\n"," \"I'll share a chart with you, and I think it's a wonderful one.\",\n"," 'Any company we look at, taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company, innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent.',\n"," \"So when we think one year, innovation isn't really that important.\",\n"," 'Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective on the same company -- suddenly, innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent.',\n"," \"But companies can't choose.\",\n"," 'They need to fund the journey and lead the long term.',\n"," 'Third: invite talent.',\n"," \"I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves.\",\n"," \"I think it's a team sport.\",\n"," 'I think we need to allow challenging.',\n"," 'I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged, and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge.',\n"," \"I think that's also what good parenting is about.\",\n"," 'Last one: be skeptical of success.',\n"," \"Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome, when the generals, after a big victory, were given their celebration.\",\n"," 'Riding into Rome on the carriage, they always had a companion whispering in their ear, \"Remember, you\\'re only human.\"',\n"," 'So I hope I made the point: balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff.',\n"," \"But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious.\",\n"," 'I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful.',\n"," 'First question is, looking at your own company: In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps, of just going on autopilot?',\n"," 'And what can you do to challenge?',\n"," 'Second question is: When did I explore something new last, and what kind of effect did it have on me?',\n"," 'Is that something I should do more of?',\n"," 'In my case, yes.',\n"," 'So let me leave you with this.',\n"," \"Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know, don't forget: the beauty is in the balance.\",\n"," 'Thank you.',\n"," 'So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure, but survive we have.',\n"," 'Our primitive ancestors, when they found their homes and livelihood endangered, they dared to make their way into unfamiliar territories in search of better opportunities.',\n"," 'And as the descendants of these explorers, we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins.',\n"," 'But at the same time, distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other, it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore.',\n"," \"We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth, and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent and just too busy to notice that its resources are finite, and that our Sun's life is also finite.\",\n"," \"While Mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel, few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space.\",\n"," 'Let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check.',\n"," 'So just a quick show of hands here: how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few days?',\n"," \"Well, that's a lot of you.\",\n"," 'How about a few weeks?',\n"," \"That's a decent amount.\",\n"," 'How about a few months?',\n"," \"That's pretty good too.\",\n"," 'Now, let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter.',\n"," 'Same questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days?',\n"," \"That's quite a lot.\",\n"," 'How about a few weeks?',\n"," 'So for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface.',\n"," 'Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found, and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of.',\n"," 'Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like Mars.',\n"," 'So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation?',\n"," 'Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth?',\n"," 'Build space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet?',\n"," 'And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?',\n"," \"But I'm getting ahead of myself.\",\n"," \"In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun, we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself, in space, on a ship, a hermetic flying can, possibly for many generations.\",\n"," 'The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.',\n"," \"From astronauts' experiences in space, we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems, among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological.\",\n"," 'And what about macrogravity, or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on?',\n"," 'In short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown.',\n"," \"So far we've been looking to this new piece of mechanical technology or that great next generation robot as part of a lineup to ensure our species safe passage in space.\",\n"," 'Wonderful as they are, I believe the time has come for us to complement these bulky electronic giants with what nature has already invented: the microbe, a single-celled organism that is itself a self-generating, self-replenishing, living machine.',\n"," 'It requires fairly little to maintain, offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube.',\n"," 'The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology.',\n"," 'It comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body.',\n"," 'Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism, microscopic or not, with incredible speed and fidelity.',\n"," 'Given the limitations of our man-made machines, synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food, our fuel and our environment, but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space.',\n"," 'To give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration, let us return to the Mars environment.',\n"," 'The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash, with trace amounts of organic material.',\n"," \"Let's say, hypothetically, what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth-derived nutrients?\",\n"," 'The first question we should probably ask is, how would we make our plants cold-tolerant?',\n"," 'Because, on average, the temperature on Mars is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade.',\n"," 'The next question we should ask is, how do we make our plants drought-tolerant?',\n"," 'Considering that most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than I can say the word \"evaporate.\"',\n"," \"Well, it turns out we've already done things like this.\",\n"," 'By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them, we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes.',\n"," \"They're known on Earth as GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization.\",\n"," 'Nature does stuff like this already, without our help.',\n"," 'We have simply found more precise ways to do it.',\n"," 'So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space?',\n"," 'Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all.',\n"," \"It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission.\",\n"," 'One of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments.',\n"," 'In essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term.',\n"," 'These organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel.',\n"," 'So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us, but what else can we do?',\n"," 'Well, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species, were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.',\n"," 'That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and I was standing there.',\n"," 'And so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute, even given ample food, water, air and a suit, we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere.',\n"," 'Unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet, we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight, or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.',\n"," 'So let us appeal to nature for inspiration.',\n"," \"Among the plethora of life here on Earth, there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles, or lovers of extreme living conditions, if you'll remember from high school biology.\",\n"," 'And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.',\n"," 'It is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid, and, most notably, radiation.',\n"," 'While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known, we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals.',\n"," 'To do so is not particularly easy.',\n"," \"There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance, and it's not as simple as transferring one gene.\",\n"," 'But given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time, I think to do so is not very hard either.',\n"," 'Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation, it would be infinitely better than what we already have, which is just the melanin in our skin.',\n"," \"Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can harness Deinococcus radiodurans' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation.\",\n"," 'As difficult as it is to see, homo sapiens, that is humans, evolves every day, and still continues to evolve.',\n"," 'Thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like Tibetans, who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions, but also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic, the chemical element that can kill the average human being.',\n"," 'Every day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations.',\n"," 'But, and this is a big but, such evolution requires two things that we may not always have, or be able to afford, and they are death and time.',\n"," \"In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe, we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on non-Earth planets.\",\n"," \"We're living in what E.O.\",\n"," 'Wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention, during which we remedy our genetic defects like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy with temporary external supplements.',\n"," 'But with every passing day, we approach the age of volitional evolution, a time during which we as a species will have the capacity to decide for ourselves our own genetic destiny.',\n"," 'Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when.',\n"," 'Using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms, especially our own, is not without its moral and ethical quandaries.',\n"," 'Will engineering ourselves make us less human?',\n"," 'But then again, what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious?',\n"," 'Where should human genius direct itself?',\n"," 'Surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it.',\n"," 'How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves?',\n"," 'I pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us.',\n"," 'We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage.',\n"," 'Mars is a destination, but it will not be our last.',\n"," \"Our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence.\",\n"," 'Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.',\n"," 'Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going.',\n"," 'The answers will lie in our choice to use or abandon the technology that we have gleaned from life itself, and it will define us for the remainder of our term in this universe.',\n"," 'Thank you.',\n"," \"OK, so, confession: I've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising.\",\n"," 'I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons, paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows, trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head.',\n"," 'Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.',\n"," 'I became a partner at a big New York ad agency.',\n"," 'But then, all of that suddenly changed on February 23, 1997, when my little brother Matt was shot in the head in a shooting that happened on the observation deck of the Empire State Building.',\n"," \"Suddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare, being told that my brother was going to die, actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him, then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted, for Matt, to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury.\",\n"," 'He is definitely my hero.',\n"," \"But as much as  -- yeah, deserves it --\\n\\nBut as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family, I often think about how much worse it could have been; in fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day who aren't as fortunate, who lose loved ones -- brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents.\",\n"," \"They don't all make national headlines.\",\n"," \"In fact, most of them don't.\",\n"," \"They go largely unnoticed, in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal.\",\n"," 'So I quit my job in advertising to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic, because I came to realize that the challenges to preventing gun violence are actually the same ones that made me love advertising, which is to try to figure out how to engage people.',\n"," 'Only instead of doing it to sell products, doing it to save lives.',\n"," 'And that comes down to finding common ground, where what I want overlaps with what you want.',\n"," 'And you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence, just how much common ground there is.',\n"," \"Let's look, for example, at people who love to hunt, a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.\",\n"," \"It's a proud tradition.\",\n"," 'Families.',\n"," 'In some places, the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday.',\n"," 'What do hunters want?',\n"," 'Well, they want to hunt.',\n"," 'They love their guns.',\n"," 'They believe deeply in the Second Amendment right to own those guns.',\n"," \"But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground.\",\n"," \"In fact, there's a lot of it, starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.\",\n"," \"This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people.\",\n"," \"It's about keeping all guns away from certain people, and it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns: convicted violent criminals, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill. We can all appreciate how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands.\",\n"," \"In 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers have blocked 2.4 million gun sales to those people that we all agree shouldn't have guns.\",\n"," \"And whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day at guns shows or online without those Brady background checks, just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane -- one with security and one with no security.\",\n"," 'And --\\n\\nAnd the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public: 90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales -- including 90 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA members.',\n"," 'This is not a controversial idea.',\n"," 'In fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees.',\n"," \"That's about the percentage of the American public that believes the moon landing was a fake.\",\n"," \"And it's also about the percentage that believes the government is putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals.\",\n"," \"That's the extent to which we agree about background checks.\",\n"," 'But what about the 300 million guns already out there in homes across America?',\n"," \"Well first, it's important to realize that those guns are mostly in the hands and homes of decent, law-abiding people like you and me, who want what we all want -- including keeping our families safe.\",\n"," \"In fact, that's why more and more people are choosing to own guns.\",\n"," 'Ten years ago, 42 percent of the American public believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun makes your home safer.',\n"," 'Today, that number is 63 percent.',\n"," 'Why?',\n"," 'I kind of hate to say it, because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising, which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times, eventually that lie becomes the truth.',\n"," \"And that's exactly what's happened here.\",\n"," \"The corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars blocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic of gun violence; blocking pediatricians from talking to parents about the dangers of guns in the home; blocking smart-gun technology and other technology that would prevent kids from firing parents' guns and would save lives.\",\n"," \"They're desperate to hide the truth, because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line.\",\n"," 'And every day, people are dying as a result.',\n"," 'And a lot of those people are children.',\n"," 'Every day in the US, nine kids are just shot unintentionally.',\n"," '900 children and teens take their own lives every year.',\n"," \"And here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun.\",\n"," 'Even two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the

put it together a different way and have, like, a parakeet or something?\",\n"," 'NR:  Um, no.',\n"," 'No, we got this.',\n"," 'LN: What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone, and

this thing, it was huge.',\n"," \"It's a really big animal.\",\n"," 'LN: So what animal could it be?',\n"," 'Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,

many years, it breaks down.',\n"," 'But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it.',\n"," 'Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called \"collagen fingerprinting.\"',\n"," 'It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen, so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to those of known species, and, who knows, maybe you get a match.',\n"," 'So she shipped him one of the fragments, FedEx.',\n"," 'NR: Yeah, you want to track it.',\n"," \"It's kind of important.\",\n"," 'LN: And he processed it, and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species.',\n"," 'And he found a match.',\n"," 'It turns out that the 3.5 million-year-old bone that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to ... a camel.',\n"," \"NR: And I'm thinking, what?\",\n"," \"That's amazing -- if it's true.\",\n"," 'LN: So they tested a bunch of the fragments, and they got the same result for each one.',\n"," 'However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels.',\n"," 'So this camel would have been about nine feet tall, weighed around a ton.',\n"," 'Yeah.',\n"," 'Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.',\n"," 'Now, when you hear the word \"camel,\" what may come to mind is one of these, the Bactrian camel of East and Central Asia.',\n"," 'But chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these, the dromedary, quintessential desert creature -- hangs out in sandy, hot places like the Middle East and the Sahara, has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks, has big, broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes.',\n"," 'So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?',\n"," \"Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are actually originally American.\",\n"," 'They started here.',\n"," 'For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around, you could only find them in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more.',\n"," 'LN: If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?',\n"," \"NR: Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes.\",\n"," \"You'll have some with really long necks, so they're actually functionally like giraffes.\",\n"," 'LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.',\n"," 'NR: The really primitive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rabbits.',\n"," 'LN: What?',\n"," 'Rabbit-sized camels?',\n"," 'NR: The earliest ones.',\n"," 'So those ones you probably would not recognize.',\n"," 'LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.',\n"," \"NR: I know, wouldn't that be great?\",\n"," 'LN: And then about three to seven million years ago, one branch of camels went down to South America, where they became llamas and alpacas, and another branch crossed over the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa.',\n"," 'And then around the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct.',\n"," \"So, scientists knew all of that already, but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north.\",\n"," 'Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara.',\n"," 'Now to be fair, three and a half million years ago, it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.',\n"," 'So it would have been boreal forest, so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.',\n"," 'But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over.',\n"," \"You'd have blizzards.\",\n"," \"You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness.\",\n"," 'Like, how ... How?',\n"," 'How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions?',\n"," 'Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer.',\n"," \"And it's kind of brilliant.\",\n"," 'What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited to places like the Sahara, actually evolved to help it get through the winter?',\n"," 'What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand, but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?',\n"," 'What if that hump -- which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat --\\n\\nwas there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter, when food was scarce?',\n"," 'And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment?',\n"," \"Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat backpack, means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body.\",\n"," 'So it helps heat dissipate easier.',\n"," \"It's this crazy idea, that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past.\",\n"," \"Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story.\",\n"," 'Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change.',\n"," 'But I love it for a totally different reason.',\n"," \"For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how that changes.\",\n"," 'So I was trained as a historian.',\n"," \"And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too.\",\n"," 'They make sense of the past.',\n"," 'They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet.',\n"," 'And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes.',\n"," 'NR: We make up stories and we stick with it, like the camel in the desert, right?',\n"," \"That's a great story!\",\n"," \"It's totally adapted for that.\",\n"," 'Clearly, it always lived there.',\n"," 'LN: But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence.',\n"," 'You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew.',\n"," 'Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought

and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer.\",\n"," 'Now, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers.',\n"," \"But in the meantime, if you are returning to work after a career break, don't hesitate to suggest an internship or an internship-like arrangement to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program.\",\n"," 'Be their first success story, and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come.',\n"," 'Thank you.',\n"," \"The following are my opinions, and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor's office.\",\n"," 'I am a prosecutor.',\n"," 'I believe in law and order.',\n"," 'I am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser.',\n"," 'I believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities.',\n"," 'I love my job and the people that do it.',\n"," \"I just think that it's our responsibility to do it better.\",\n"," 'By a show of hands, how many of you, by the age of 25, had either acted up in school, went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of, or drank alcohol before your legal age?',\n"," 'All right.',\n"," 'How many of you shoplifted, tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight -- yes, even with a sibling?',\n"," 'Now, how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions?',\n"," \"How many of you sitting here today think that you're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?\",\n"," 'Point taken.',\n"," \"When we talk about criminal justice reform, we often focus on a few things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today.\",\n"," \"But first I'm going to -- since you shared with me, I'm going to give you a confession on my part.\",\n"," 'I went to law school to make money.',\n"," \"I had no interest in being a public servant, I had no interest in criminal law, and I definitely didn't think that I would ever be a prosecutor.\",\n"," 'Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court.',\n"," 'I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston, plagued by gun violence and drug crime.',\n"," 'My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship.',\n"," 'I walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people who, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only: \"Not guilty.\"',\n"," 'They were predominately black and brown.',\n"," 'And then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input.',\n"," 'They were predominately white.',\n"," \"As each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom, I couldn't stop but think: How did they get here?\",\n"," 'I wanted to know their stories.',\n"," 'And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case, I was thinking to myself, we could have predicted that.',\n"," 'That seems so preventable... not because I was an expert in criminal law, but because it was common sense.',\n"," 'Over the course of the internship, I began to recognize people in the auditorium, not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any.',\n"," 'My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney, and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder.',\n"," 'Even in our \"worst,\" I saw human stories.',\n"," 'And they all contained childhood trauma, victimization, poverty, loss, disengagement from school, early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system, all leading to a seat in a courtroom.',\n"," \"Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison, and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years when we could have reinvested it up front, and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place.\",\n"," 'My third year of law school, I defended people accused of small street crimes, mostly mentally ill, mostly homeless, mostly drug-addicted, all in need of help.',\n"," 'They would come to us, and we would send them away without that help.',\n"," 'They were in need of our assistance.',\n"," \"But we weren't giving them any.\",\n"," 'Prosecuted, adjudged and defended by people who knew nothing about them.',\n"," 'The staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work.',\n"," 'The unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender.',\n"," 'The power dynamic that I came to understand made me become a prosecutor.',\n"," \"I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem.\",\n"," 'We know the criminal justice system needs reform, we know there are 2.3 million people in American jails and prisons, making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet.',\n"," \"We know there's another seven million people on probation or parole, we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color, particularly poor people of color.\",\n"," 'And we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms.',\n"," 'But what we do not discuss is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them.',\n"," 'When we talk about criminal justice reform, we, as a society, focus on three things.',\n"," 'We complain, we tweet, we protest about the police, about sentencing laws and about prison.',\n"," 'We rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor.',\n"," 'In the fall of 2009, a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department.',\n"," 'He was 18 years old, he was African American and he was a senior at a local public school.',\n"," \"He had his sights set on college but his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school.\",\n"," 'In a series of bad decisions, he stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet.',\n"," 'This led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges.',\n"," 'The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most.',\n"," 'But what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future.',\n"," \"I was standing in arraignments that day when Christopher's case came across my desk.\",\n"," \"And at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment, I had Christopher's life in my hands.\",\n"," \"I was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor, and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make would impact Christopher's life.\",\n"," \"Christopher's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such, but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer.\",\n"," 'For the most part, prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions, regardless of our intent.',\n"," 'Despite our broad discretion, we learn to avoid risk at all cost, rendering our discretion basically useless.',\n"," 'History has conditioned us to believe that somehow, the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety, despite evidence to the contrary.',\n"," \"We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins, so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative at our case positions, dispositions, or to take risks on people we might not otherwise.\",\n"," \"We stick to an outdated method, counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want, and that's safer communities.\",\n"," 'Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher.',\n"," 'They have little appreciation for what we can do.',\n"," 'Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record, making it harder for him to get a job, setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today.',\n"," 'With a criminal record and without a job, Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing.',\n"," 'Without those protective factors in his life, Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime.',\n","
