Scene description languages\n==============================\n\nNFF\n---\n  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some\n  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects\n  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in\n  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can\n  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.\n  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)\n\nOFF\n---\n  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).\n[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,\n I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]\n\n  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this\n  service, send a message with a \"Subject:\" line containing only the word\n  \"help\" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.\n  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF\n  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in\n  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,\n  also on gondwana.\n\nTDDD\n----\nIt's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,\nRayshade, Imagine or vort objects.\nEdited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):\n\n  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley\n  (worley@cup.portal.com)\n\n  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format\n  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,\n  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely\n  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.\n\n  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file\n  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the\n  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially\n  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various\n  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,\n  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables\n  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views\n  in Postscript.\n\nP3D\n---\n  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight\n  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp\n  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to\n  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.\n\n  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon\n  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D\n  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.\n\n  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:\n  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,\n  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from\n  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.\n\n  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines\n  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory\n  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.\n\nRenderMan\n---------\n  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.\n\n==========================================================================\n\n8. Solids description formats\n=============================\n\na. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a\n  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and\n  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided\n  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)\n\nb. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid\n  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987\n  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at\n  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325\n  and the cost is $100.\n  This standard is not available in electronic format.\n\nc. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only\n  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.\n  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get\n  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov\n  and putting the line\n\tsend index\n  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.\n\n  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working\n  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,\n  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.\n  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.\n\n  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),\n  e-mail: mm@inf.rl.ac.uk or {...!}mcsun!uknet!rlinf!mm or\n          mm%inf.rl.ac.uk@NSFnet-relay.ac.uk\n\n==========================================================================\n\nEnd of Part 1 of the Resource Listing",

         "The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on\na curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\nwouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the\nlove and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we\nare all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But\nthe Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only\nthe best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love.\nIt's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it\nand who doesn't.

         "\n\nI don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.\n\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\nlike DES) for the encryption.\n\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\n\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's\nsecret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\nstraightforward to me.)\n\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\n\nIt's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.",

It is \ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\n\n\n\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers\nyou're gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\nIsrael's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\n\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\nwould have resulted in.  \nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's \npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\n  \n\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\n\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \noccupying soldier is attacked.\n \n",

         "terminated\n\nIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any\nmacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",

I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.\nIt's small enough that I will attach it.\n\nI have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB\ncache.

It's appreciated that you will use Archie\nbefore asking help in the newsgroups.\n\nArchie servers:\n  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)\n  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)\n  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)\n  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)\n  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)\n  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)\n  archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (TWN)\n  archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (UK/Ireland)\n  archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (USA [MD])\n  archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (USA [NE])\n  archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (USA [NY])\n  archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (USA [NJ])\n  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)\n\nConnect to Archie server with telnet and type \"archie\" as username.\nTo get help type 'help'.\nYou can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie\nwithout the burden of a telnet session.\n'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,\nvol. 27.\n\nTo get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with\nsubject \"help\" to \"archie\" account at any of above sites.\n\n(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is\naccessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].\nConnect to it and specify \"archie\" as the host name and \"archie\" as\nthe username.)\n\n==========================================================================\n\n2. Notes\n========\n(Excerpted from the FAQ article)\n\nPlease do *not* post or mail messages saying \"I can't FTP, could\nsomeone mail this to me?\"  There are a number of automated mail servers\nthat will send you things like this in response to a message.\n\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\n\n==========================================================================\n\n3.

To send\n  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.\n  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com\n  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not\n  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.\n\nBITFTP\n------\n  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.\n  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.\n\nLightwave 3D mail based file-server\n-----------------------------------\n  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images\n  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.\n  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list\n  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for\n  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.\n\n  The server resides on a BBS called \"The Graphics BBS\".

These objects range from human figures to airplanes,\n  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely\n  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.\n\n  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file\n  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the\n  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially\n  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various\n  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,\n  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables\n  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views\n  in Postscript.\n\nP3D\n---\n  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight\n  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp\n  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to\n  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.\n\n  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon\n  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D\n  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.\n\n  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:\n  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,\n  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from\n  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.\n\n  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines\n  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory\n  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.\n\nRenderMan\n---------\n  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.\n\n==========================================================================\n\n8.

         "The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on\na curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\nwouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the\nlove and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we\nare all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But\nthe Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only\nthe best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love.\nIt's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it\nand who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the\nother place. But it is really much more than that...\nThere are few experts.

         "\n\nI don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.\n\nSeveral people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\nAnother possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\nalgorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\nlike DES) for the encryption.\n\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\n\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's\nsecret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\nstraightforward to me.)\n\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\n\nIt's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.",

It is \ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\n\n\n\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers\nyou're gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\nIsrael's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\n\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\nwould have resulted in.  \nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's \npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\n  \n\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\n\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \noccupying soldier is attacked.\n \n",

When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it\nseemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal\nshould be terminated at all the ends.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions.",
